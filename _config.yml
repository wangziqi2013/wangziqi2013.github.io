  This site serves as a public repository for my PhD research work. I will keep
  posting research papers that I read. This site is *NOT* intended as an official
  demonstration of my work at Carnegie Mellon University. For more information, 
  especially for academic or employment matters, please visit my LinkedIn and 
  CMU personal webpage.
