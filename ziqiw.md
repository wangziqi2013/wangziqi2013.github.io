Research Goal
-------------

I am a PhD student working with Professor [Todd Mowry](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tcm/ "Todd Mowry's homepage") since 2017 Fall. 
My research area is computer architecture and memory architecture, especially [Hardware Transaction Memory (HTM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_memory "Transactional Memory"), and
[Page Overlays](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~omutlu/pub/page-overlays-for-fine-grained-memory-management_isca15.pdf "Page Overlays").
I was also working closely with Processor [Andy Pavlo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/ "Andy Pavlo's homepage") during my
Masters education at CMU, and my research project was efficient indexing for in-memory databases. 

Projects
--------

**(2016.04 - 2017.03)** As a Master student at CMU Master of Science in Computer Science program, I contributed to 
[Peloton](https://github.com/cmu-db/peloton "Peloton Github"), an 
open-source self-driving in-memory database system optimized for HTAP workloads. My main contribution is the lock-free B+Tree index, the 
BwTree. I implemented the BwTree based on a [Microsoft Reaearch paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bw-tree-icde2013-final.pdf "BwTree Paper"), and measured its performance under YCSB benchmark.

**(2017.03 - 2017.07)** As a research associative intern at CMU Institute of Software Research (ISR), I contributed to the 
[Usable Privacy Policy Project (UPPP)](https://www.usableprivacy.org/ "UPPP") under the supervision of Professor Norman Sadeh. 
I implemented a static analysis framework using call graph analysis for Android apps. 

**(2017.09 - Present)** I am working with Professor Todd Mowry on page overlay and hardware transaction memory.
