I am a PhD student with Professor [Todd Mowry](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tcm/ "Todd Mowry's homepage") since 2017 Fall. 
My research area is computer architecture and memory architecture, especially [Hardware Transaction Memory (HTM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_memory "Transactional Memory"), and
Page [Overlays](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~omutlu/pub/page-overlays-for-fine-grained-memory-management_isca15.pdf "Page Overlays").
I was also working closely with Processor [Andy Pavlo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/ "Andy Pavlo's homepage") during my
Masters education at CMU, and my research project was about efficient indexing for in-memory databases.
