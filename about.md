Search Help
===========
{:id="search_help"}
The index page has a search box, in which you can type a search string, and filter out 
unwanted posts by category, by title, or by keywords.

The search string is a semicolon (";") separated string, in which each substring
separated by semicolons is a search keyword. For each search keyword, posts that do not
have the keyword in its category/title/keyword will be hidden (case insensitive). 
The final search result will be the union of all search keywords (i.e. search keywords 
are connected by logical "OR").
