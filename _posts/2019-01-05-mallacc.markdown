This paper proposes mallacc, a special purpose hardware design that accelerates the C heap memory allocation API: malloc().
Malloc, as one of the most important C library functions, are performance critical and must complete within only a few 
cycles. We briefly describe common designs of state-of-the-art malloc in this paragraph. Users call malloc() with the 
size of the request, which is the minimum amount of memory that the allocator should return. On receiving the request, the 
allocator aligns the requested size, and rounds it up to the nearest size available for allocation. Keeping the number of 
available sizes in a reasonable range achieves a balance between internal fragmentation (memory under-utilization because
not all allocated spaces are used by the user program) and the space taken to maintain metadata which can have a negative 
effect on performance if the metadata size is too large and cannot fit into the cache. Free memory blocks of each size class 
are usually maintained per size bucket in the form of linked lists. The allocator removes the head element from the list
and returns it to the user if the list is non-empty. To avoid synchronization overheads, each thread maintains their own 
size buckets and size classes. If a size bucket is empty, the allocator either tries to claim more memory blocks from a 
larger bucket, or from the higher level memory pool. The memory pool is a shared data structure, which itself can also 
be hierarchical and consists of multiple smaller pools. Accesses to the memory pool usually requires locking or other forms
of synchronizaton. During normal operation, the first level buckets will be accessed most frequently, which is the fast-path
of allocation. The paper suggests that the fast-path is already quite highly optimized, and only takes 20 to 30 cycles to 
complete. In the following sections, we use tcmalloc as a typical example to illustrate how mallacc improves the performance
of memory allocation. The hardware design, however, is totally general and can be equally applied to other malloc
implemetations (partially because the fast-path is performance critical, and hence different malloc implementations are 
largely the same or at least very similar to each other).
