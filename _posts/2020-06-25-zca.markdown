**Highlight:**

This paper proposes zero-content augmented caches (ZCA cache), a simple cache compression scheme that only compresses
zero-filled 64 byte blocks. The paper begins by identifying three important properties of zero-filled blocks in 
common workloads. First, a non-trivial number of cache blocks are filled with zero for reasons such as zero initialization
or using zeros to represent a common state (e.g. NULL pointers, default values).
