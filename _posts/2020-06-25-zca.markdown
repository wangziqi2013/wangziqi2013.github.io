This paper proposes zero-content augmented caches (ZCA cache), a simple cache compression scheme that only compresses
zero-filled 64 byte blocks. The paper begins by identifying three important properties of zero-filled blocks in 
common workloads. First, a non-trivial number of cache blocks are filled with zero for reasons such as zero initialization
or using zeros to represent a common state (e.g. NULL pointers, default values). Such regularities in application's data
value pattern enable the cache controller to perform zero compression by eliminating the need to store these easily
compressable blocks. In addition, some applications even demonstrate high percentage of zero blocks throughout the entire
execution, indicating the effectiveness of zero compression on these workloads.
