This paper proposes ReVive, a general purpose rollback recovery mechanism for shared-memory multiprocessors. There are 
two design goals: Software rollback and crash recovery. Software rollback requires the system to preserve a consistent
snapshot of system states. On a rollback request, the state snapshot is quickly restored, and system execution resumes 
from the restoration point as if nothing has ever happened. Crash recovery focuses on the scenario where one or more 
components of the system malfunction and cause data loss. A previously saved system snapshot must be loaded from some
external sources, or rebuilt from remaining available information after the crash. In the case of ReVive, since all data i
s stored in DRAM and hence is volatile, we only consider recovery from detectable errors caused by malfunctioning memory 
modules.
