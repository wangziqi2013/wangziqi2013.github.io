This paper proposes Logless Atomic Durability (LAD), a hardware framework for supporting failure atomic transactions in
which no logging is involved for most of the time. The paper identified the problem of software logging as write amplification
and excessive write orderings which require persist barrier to be issued quite often, degrading performance. The paper also 
identifies that hardware schemes, such as Kiln, are making unrealistic assumptions which make the propal less attractive.
For example, Kiln assumes that the LLC is manufactured using STT-RAM and that the LLC can atomically commit a transaction
by performing a battery-backed cache tag walk. Neither of these two assumptions is realistic nowadays. Today's LLC is still
manufactured using SRAM, and is quite unlikely to be replaced by STT-RAM in the near future. Furthermore,
