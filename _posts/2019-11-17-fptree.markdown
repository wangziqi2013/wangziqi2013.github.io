This paper presents FPTree, a B+Tree designed for byte-addressable non-volatile memory. This paper points out, at a high 
level, several challenges of implementing data structures for NVM. First, the data structure should be able to recover to
a consistent state after a crash. This is typically achieved by flushing certain data back to the NVM to enforce write
ordering between metadata (commit mark, log entry, etc.) and data using persistence barrier. There are three common patterns
for ensuring consistency. The first pattern is
