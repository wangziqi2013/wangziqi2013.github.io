This paper proposes Touche, a cache compression tagging scheme for reducing tag storage overhead on compression cache slots.
Conventional cache compression schemes often require adding more tags for the same number of data slots, and loosen the 
static mapping relation between tag and data slots. This way, more logical lines can be stored in the compressed form within
a single data slot, while more than one tags are used to address them. A set lookup should read all the tags out and 
compare them with the requested address to determine if the requests hits or not.
