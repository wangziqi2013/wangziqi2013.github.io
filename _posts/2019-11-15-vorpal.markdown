This paper proposes Vorpal, a novel vector clock based scheme for ensuring memory persistence order on byte-addressable 
NVM. The paper assumes a programming model called Failure-Atomic Sections (FASE), which are critical sections synchronized
using locks whose modifications are expected to be persisted to the NVM. An FASE must observe two properties. First, all
modifications within an FASE should be atomic, i.e. either all stores are persisted, or none of them is persisted. Second,
during recovery, if a FASE is rolled back, then none of the FASEs that depent on it should be persisted. In other words,
data flow ordering should also be obeyed when determining whether a FASE should persist or be rolled back during recovery.
