This paper proposes a parallel compression algorithm with an LZ-family block-referential dictionary searching.
The paper is motived by the three general design goals of LZ-family compression algorithms: High throughput,
good compression ratio, and small block size.
Previous approaches often favor compression ratio more, at the cost of low compression and decompression throughput.
while this paper suggests that by leveraging algorithmic level parallelism, all three goals can be achieved.
