This paper presents EXCITE-VM, a software-based virtual memory extension that enables snapshot isolation semantics
for individual threads.
The paper is motivated by two observations. First, multicore programming for non-regular data structures, such as 
graphs, are non-trivial as frequent thread synchronization is required to avoid data corruption. Besides, reliability
may also be a concern in a multi-threaded environment if threads may fail due to invalid operations or accesses.
Second, although Software Transactional Memory (STM) is a suitable programming paradigm for multicore synchronization,
they often require a software indirection layer for multiversioning semantics. The indirection layer needs to be 
invoked on every load and store instructions, which adds extra cycle and data overhead to the original application.

EXCITE-VM addresses the above two issues using Snapshot Isolation (SI) abstraction provided by virtual memory systems. 
To simplify thread synchronization, each thread in EXCITE-VM reads from a consistent snapshot that is only determined 
by the begin timestamp of the thread's transaction, which remains unaffected by concurrent threads that commit onto
the actual memory image.
