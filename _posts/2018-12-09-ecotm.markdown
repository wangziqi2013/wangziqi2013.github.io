This paper proposes EcoTM, an HTM design that performs conflict detection using a hierarchy of 
conflict maps. In a classical Eager-Lazy HTM, conflicts are detected on a distributed manner, 
usually as a side-effect of cache coherence: Transactionally accessed cache lines are marked 
by the local L1/L2 cache, and conflicting accesses are detected as a coherence message is issued
by another processor. This scheme, simple as it is, faces several challenges that must be addressed 
by a more practical HTM design.
