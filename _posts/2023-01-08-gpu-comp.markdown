This paper proposes a technique for compressing GPGPU TLB entries to accommodate the increasingly irregular
access pattern of modern GPU workloads. The paper is motivated by the observation that modern GPGPU workloads 
suffer a high L2 TLB miss ratio which can become a performance bottleneck under Unified Virtual Memory (UVM).
The paper proposes to compress the TLB translation entry by extracting the common high bits of both virtual
and physical addresses and storing compressed translation entries in the hardware structure for reduced misses.
