This paper presents Trident, an OS kernel mechanism that enables 1GB huge pages for general applications.
The paper is motivated by the fact that today's processor's 1GB huge page support is largely wasted due to not being
used in most applications. Meanwhile, users are still penalized even if the support is not enabled because of 
the hardware resource dedicated to it.
The paper proposes a software mechanism that enables applications to leverage 1GB huge pages for better performance,
with a combination of techniques to ensure that large 1GB addresses can be efficiently found.

The paper points out that there are currently two ways of leveraging huge pages. 
First, huge pages can be mapped explicitly using a helper library, most notably libHugetlbfs, and the OS will set up
the mapping eagerly by allocating 2MB or 1GB chunks or physical memory, and mapping the corresponding virtual
addresses to it.
Second, huge pages may also be leveraged in the background by an OS kernel thread compacting data pages into 2MB
chunks, and then mapping user space memory using 2MB huge pages whenever it is possible.
This approach is implemented in the Linux kernel as Transparent Huge Page (THP), but only 2MB huge pages are supported.

The paper then lists several reasons that 1GB huge pages are not widely adopted.
First, there lacks sufficient evidence to show the performance benefits brought by 1GB huge pages, compared with 
only using 2MB pages.
Second, in earlier processor models, there was only a very limited number of TLB entries for 1GB pages.
As a result, when the amount of memory mapped with 1GB pages exceed the maximum supported on hardware,
TLB thrashing would occur, which degrades performance.
Lastly, software support for 1GB huge pages is difficult to build, mostly because finding large 1GB chunks of physical
memory is challenging, and often poses a great overhead due to the amount of data copy involved.
