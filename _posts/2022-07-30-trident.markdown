This paper presents Trident, an OS kernel mechanism that enables 1GB huge pages for general applications.
The paper is motivated by the fact that today's processor's 1GB huge page support is largely wasted due to not being
used in most applications. Meanwhile, users are still penalized even if the support is not enabled because of 
the hardware resource dedicated to it.
The paper proposes a software mechanism that enables applications to leverage 1GB huge pages for better performance,
with a combination of techniques to ensure that large 1GB addresses can be efficiently found.
