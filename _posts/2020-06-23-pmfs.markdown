This paper introduces PMFS, a file system designed and optimized for NVM. Unlike previous NVM file system papers in which
a concrete problem with other designs are identified and then solved, this paper is closer to a design document covering
the high-level designs while explaining design motivations. The paper begins by identifying three different ways of extending
existing file system paradigm to work with NVM. The first is to abandon file system totally, and shift the responsibility
of resource management to the OS's virtual memory manager. The second way is to only change the block layer interface and
use the NVM as conventional block device with lower latency and higher throughput. The last is to partially abandon the 
block layer abstraction and the disk buffer cache, reducing software stack and data movement overhead, but maintain the
conventional file system interface and semantics.

The paper chose the last for three reasons.
