**Highlight:**

1. Using super blocks to implicitly generate addresses on lookups without adding more tags, since the address of cache lines
   within a super block is easily derived from the base super block address.

2. Using different associativity for 4:1 case and 2:1 or uncompressed case. 4:1 blocks are statically mapped since each block
   can be statically allocated a 16B slot. 2:1 and uncompressed case requires fully associative mapping between block
   ID and physical slot offset since not all blocks in the SB can be allocated physical storage.
   Using different layouts for different SB cases saves some bits for the tag.

**Lowlight:**

1. In understand the motivation of this article as being a compromised design between complicated SCC/DCC and uncompressed
   cache. But without these motivations YACC is just a really common super block compressed cache with little novelty involved.

This article proposes Yet Another Compressed Cache (YACC), a compressed Last-Level Cache (LLC) design that improves over
the previous overly complicated DCC and SCC designs. The paper begins by pointing out that both DCC and SCC designs
