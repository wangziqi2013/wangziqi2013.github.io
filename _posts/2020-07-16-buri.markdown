This journal article proposes Buri, a hardware main memory compression scheme designed for big-data workloads. 
The paper observes that due to the high memory demand of big memory workloads, simple scaling up the number of 
cores and memory modules is no longer possible or finacially feasible to extend the amount of memory in a system.
Hardware memory compression, on the other hand, reduces the amount of physical storage required for these workloads 
without installing more components.
