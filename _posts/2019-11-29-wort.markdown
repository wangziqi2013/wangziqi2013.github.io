This paper proposes WORT, an algorithm for implementing radix tree and its variant, Adaptive Radix Tree (ART), on 
persistent memory. The paper identifies that it is challenging to make B+Trees persistent, since B+Tree maintains
keys within a node in sorted order for efficient search. In order to update a node, either we no longer require such
sorted property of nodes, and update nodes in append-only manner or we add an extra level of indirection, and relies on 
atomic update of the indirection word to insert keys atomically while maintaining sorted order. Both methods have problems,
as append-only updates hurts search performance for large nodes due to loss of sorted key property, and the indirection
level incurs more memory accesses which results in longer critical path.
