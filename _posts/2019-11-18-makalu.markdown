This paper presents Makalu, a memory allocator for byte-addressable non-volatile memory. This paper identifies three challenges
of implementing memory allocator for NVM due to its non-volatility. The first challenge is to maintain the consistency of 
allocator metadata, since memory allocator itself also maintains a set of data structures, both non-volatile core and 
volatile auxiliary data structure, to facilitate efficient allocation and deallocation. To reduce persistency overhead
of changing non-volatile states atomically with regard to failures, prior researches usually only maintain the consistency 
of core data structure, while relying on a post-crash recovery routine to rebild auxiliary data structures. This way, 
most allocation requests can be satisfied using DRAM-only auxiliary data structure, while the costly NVM allocation can 
be amortized. The second challenge
