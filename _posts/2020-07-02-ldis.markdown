This paper proposes line distillation (LDIS), a technique for dynamically increasing cache associativity. 
This paper identifies that in most workloads, not all words in a cache block are accessed equally by the processor before 
the line is evicted from the cache. This motivates the design that cache lines are only partially evicted, and words 
that are likely to be reused in the near future be cached by a small word level store. Since only partial data is stored
per line, more lines can be "squeezed" into a physical slot, increasing effective associativity.
