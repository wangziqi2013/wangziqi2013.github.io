This paper proposes a main memory compression technique for embedded systems. Embedded systems are often deployed in
environments where energy supply is limited and hence should be utilized wisely.
The paper is motived by previous proposals that perform instruction compression for reducing energy consumption,
and it extends compression to data memory.
The challenge, however, is that data memory must be optimized for both compression and decompression, as both will
be performed online and are performance critical. Instruction compression, on the other hand, only needs to be fast 
on decompression, as instructions can be compressed off-line, and will unlikely be modified in the runtime.

The paper identifies two reasons why data compression helps saving energy. First, less data bits are streamed from
the main memory on accesses, which can reduce power related to row buffer activities.
Second, since blocks are transferred over the memory bus in compressed form, the bus also enjoys the energy benefit
