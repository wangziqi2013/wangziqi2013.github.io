This paper proposes a main memory compression technique for embedded systems. Embedded systems are often deployed in
environments where energy supply is limited and hence should be utilized wisely.
The paper is motived by previous proposals that perform instruction compression for reducing energy consumption,
and it extends compression to data memory.
The challenge, however, is that data memory must be optimized for both compression and decompression, as both will
be performed online and are performance critical. Instruction compression, on the other hand, only needs to be fast 
on decompression, as instructions can be compressed off-line, and will unlikely be modified in the runtime.

The paper identifies two reasons why data compression helps saving energy. First, less data bits are streamed from
the main memory on accesses, which can reduce power related to row buffer activities.
Second, since blocks are transferred over the memory bus in compressed form, the bus also enjoys the energy benefit
of compression, as less bits are being transferred.
Despite previous studies which show that the extra hardware added for compression will offset the energy benefit 
of reduced data activity, the paper argues that compression can still be beneficial if the compression circuit
is designed to be simple enough.

We next describe the overall architecture. The compression scheme works for data transferred between the LLC and the
main memory. The proposed logic is implemented as a Compression and Decompression Unit (CDU), which is inserted
on the datapath between the LLC and the main memory. Data written back from the LLC is first compressed before it is
sent to the memory bus. Access requests to the main memory are also intercepted by the CDU, and the CDU fetches
the requested block from the main memory in either compressed or uncompressed form. 
The CDU is put on the LLC side such that data transfers between the LLC and the main memory use compressed blocks
whenever possible.

Memory blocks are stored in the DRAM in compressed form. Not all blocks are compressed, though. The paper proposes
that part of the main memory be dedicated to storing compressed blocks (called a compressed region), while the 
rest still stores uncompressed data. The paper noted that this is equivalent to having a compressed DRAM buffer 
between the LLC and the uncompressed main memory.
