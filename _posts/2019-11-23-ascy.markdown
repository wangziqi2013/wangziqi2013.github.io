Thie paper proposes Asynchronous Concurrency (ASCY), a programming principle for designing concurrent data structures.
The paper first identifies that the major source for scalability issues in concurrent data structures are store instructions
to shared data which will cause these stores be serialized by the cache coherence protocol. In addition, without careful
evaluation of these stores, they may also incur long-than-usual dynamic code path (e.g. in the form of retry), which 
negatively affects both overall performance and power dissipation.
