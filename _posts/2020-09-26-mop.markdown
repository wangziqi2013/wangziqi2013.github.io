This paper proposes mostly order preserving dictionary (MOP), a database compression technique for fast dictionary encoding 
and mostly decoding-free range query. MOP is motived by order preserving dictionaries, which is one of the order preserving 
techniques that map large, repeated values to smaller code words, reducing the number of bits required to represent
the value. The mapping relation is stored as a seperate dictionary for further encoding or decoding. 

Before MOP, previous work has proposed order preserving dictionary designs to achieve both compression and decoding-free
query execution. An order preserving dictionary delivers the guarantee that the numeric order of encoded values is consistent
with the total ordering of unencoded values. This property optimizes range queries based on field values, since the query
does not require decoding the compressed field in order to select the correct tuples.
