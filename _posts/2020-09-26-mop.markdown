This paper proposes mostly order preserving dictionary (MOP), an encoding technique for fast dictionary encoding and 
mostly decoding-free range query. MOP is motived by order preserving dictionaries, which is one of the order preserving 
techniques that map large, repeated values to smaller code words, reducing the number of bits required to represent
the value. The mapping relation is stored as a seperate dictionary for further encoding or decoding.
