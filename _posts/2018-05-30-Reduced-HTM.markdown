Hybrid transactional memory can provide the efficiency and parallelism of hardware transactional 
memory by executing the majority of transactions via the hardware path, while maintain the flexibility
of software transactional memory when hardware fails to commit using the slower software based path.
The interoperability between HTM and STM transactions is achieved by designing the algorithm
in a way that both HTM and STM transactions would notify each other of possible conflicts. 

This paper proposes two hybrid transactional memory algorithms based on TL2.
