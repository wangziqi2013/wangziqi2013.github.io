This paper proposes Attache, a main memory compression framework for reducing bandwidth using special signatures.
Main memory compression is proposed in prior publications to serve two main purposes. First, memory compression
reduces bus bandwidth consumption by transferring compressed blocks, which are variably sized and are smaller than
uncompressed block, instead of fix sized cache blocks. Second, more blocks can fit into the same amount of physical
storage, if compressed blocks are stored in a way that the extra space can be collected and taken advantage of.
Conventional main memory scheme faces two major challenges. First, the compressed
