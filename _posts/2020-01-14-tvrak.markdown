This paper presents Tvarak, a hardware design for NVM redundancy management. The paper points out that redundancy is 
critical for certain types of NVM applications to avoid firmware bugs or random data corruption. The paper also identifies
several types of data corruption, such as unexpectedly dropped writes, corrupted mapping table, and random bit flips.
To deal with these problems, a classical method is to compute a page checksum for each 4KB page in the page buffer before 
it is written back to the disk. The checksum is stored in a separate bank or device to minimize the chance of correlated 
failures.
