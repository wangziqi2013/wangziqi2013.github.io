This paper presents Tvarak, a hardware design for NVM redundancy management. The paper points out that redundancy is 
critical for certain types of NVM applications to avoid firmware bugs or random data corruption. The paper also identifies
several types of data corruption, such as unexpectedly dropped writes, corrupted mapping table, and random bit flips.
To deal with these problems, a classical method is to compute a page checksum for each 4KB page in the page buffer before 
it is written back to the disk. The checksum is stored in a separate bank or device to minimize the chance of correlated 
failures. With NVM directed mapped access (DAX) enabled, however, this scheme no longer works, since the DAX address 
space is directly mapped onto the NVM device's physical address space, rather than to a page buffer. The consequence
is that the OS no longer has control over which pages are being modified in the DAX address space and which ones are 
written back, since the dirty bit and write back mechanism are now both controlled by the hardware.
