This paper presents Pisces, a software transactional memory design for Non-Volatile DIMM. Pisces uses a limited form
of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) protocol, dual version concurrency control (DVCC), to implement snapshot-isolation
(SI) transactional semantics. The paper points out that SI is feasible for NVM, since unlike serializable transactions,
read-write dependencies do not need to be observed on recovery. Otherwise
