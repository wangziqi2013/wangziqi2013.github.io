This paper proposes Nocstar, a novel design for fast access of distributed L2 TLB. Traditionally, to perform address
translation, when L1 TLB misses, the page walker will be initiated to query the in-memory page table. Due to the high
latency of memory accesses and the long sequence of dependent operations during the page walk, an L2 TLB is further 
added to reduce the miss rate which result in costly page walks.
