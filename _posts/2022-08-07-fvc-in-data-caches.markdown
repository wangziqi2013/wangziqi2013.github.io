This paper proposes Frequent Value Compression in L1 data cache. The paper is motivated by frequent value locality,
a data phenomenon that a small number of frequently occurring values constitute a large portion of a program's working
set and memory traffic.
The design leverages a static dictionary, and encodes values in the cache blocks using dictionary entries.
