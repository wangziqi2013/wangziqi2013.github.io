This paper proposes Carat Cake, a compiler-OS co-design that eliminates the need for the hardware memory management 
unit (MMU) and TLB while providing the same level of address mapping and protection. Carat Cake is motivated by the 
high performance and power overhead of today's address translation infrastructure and aims at eliminating the overhead
completely thus allowing applications to be directly executed on the physical address space.
