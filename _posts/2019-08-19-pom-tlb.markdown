This paper proposes Part-of-Memory TLB (POM-TLB), a novel design that adds a L3 TLB to the existing address translation
hierarchy. The paper sets its context under virtualization in which address translation can be a major bottleneck
due to 2-D page table walk and frequent context switch between VMs. To solve this problem, previous researches proposed 
several solutions, including adding a larger L2 TLB to increase the address coverage, using multiple hardware page walkers 
to serve multiple requests from different cores concurrently (processors stall on TLB miss), and adding a cache dedicated 
to intermediate entries of page table walk. These solutions, however, either add non-negligible hardware overheads and 
verification cost, or pose new challenge and trade-offs to address.
