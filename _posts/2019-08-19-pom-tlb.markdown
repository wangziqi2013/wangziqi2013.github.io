This paper proposes Part-of-Memory TLB (POM-TLB), a novel design that adds a L3 TLB to the existing address translation
hierarchy. The paper sets its context under virtualization in which address translation can be a major bottleneck
due to 2-D page table walk and frequent context switch between VMs.
