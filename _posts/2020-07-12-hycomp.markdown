This paper proposes HyComp, a cache compression framework with high compression ratio for all data types using multiple
compression algorithms. The paper is motivated by the observation that most compression algorithms are only capable of
compressing a certain with high compression ratio, while leaving data of incompatible types less compressed, introducing
a huge bias depending on the application and the data types used. The difference between compression capabilities is 
a consequence of different assumptions on sources of redundancy. For example, FPC
