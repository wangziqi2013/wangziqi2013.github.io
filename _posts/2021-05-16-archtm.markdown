This paper presents ArchTM, a durable software transactional memory design for byte-addressable non-volatile memory.
The paper is motivated by the discrepancy between previous NVM transactional framework proposals that use emulated or 
simulated NVM device and the actual hardware performance characteristics of commercial NVM device.
Previous designs tend to overestimate write performance and underestimate the write granularity for NVM devices due
to lack of precise information and using throttled DRAM device for emulation.
