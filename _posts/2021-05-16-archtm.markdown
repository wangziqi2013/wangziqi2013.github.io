This paper presents ArchTM, a durable software transactional memory design for byte-addressable non-volatile memory.
The paper is motivated by the discrepancy between previous NVM transactional framework proposals that use emulated or 
simulated NVM device and the actual hardware performance characteristics of commercial NVM device.
Previous designs tend to overestimate write performance and underestimate the write granularity for NVM devices due
to lack of precise information and using throttled DRAM device for emulation.

The actual NVM device, however, demonstrates different characteristics than DRAM in the following way.
First, NVM devices generally sustain much lower write throughput than read throughput. Writing large amount of 
data into the device, therefore, will severely degrade performance.
This discourages putting non-essential metadata on the NVM since metadata will be updated frequently.
Second, NVM devices exhibit optimal performance on multiples of 256B writes. This is caused by its internal
write combining buffer whose size is exactly 256 bytes. Writes belonging to the same 256 byte block will likely
be combined in the buffer, without accessing the physical storage medium.
This implies that application should refrain from writing small data items to randomly addresses; In other words,
NVM devices prefer large and consecutive writes in order to achieve optimal performance.
