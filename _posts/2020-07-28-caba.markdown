**Note: I am not an expert on GPGPU architecture, and have only read very basic GPGPU architecture literatures. The following
paper summary may be inaccurate and/or incorrect when it involves GPGPU internals. I will strive to clarify as much as I can,
and put the focus on compression rather than GPGPU.**
