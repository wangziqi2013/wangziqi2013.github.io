This paper proposes Jukebox, an instruction cache prefetching mechanism designed to reduce instruction
cache misses for short-lived serverless functions. 
The paper is motivated by the three distinctive properties of serverless functions, which are not observed on
other types of cloud services.
First, serverless functions generally have short execution time, in the unit of milliseconds, and small
memory footprint, which is usually within a few hundreds of megabytes, due to the fact that most functions are
deployed for web services, and they only perform simple tasks such as HTML rendering.
