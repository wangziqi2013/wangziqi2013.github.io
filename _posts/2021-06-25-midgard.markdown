This paper proposes Midgard, a novel virtual memory framework for reduced translation overhead on the critical path.
The paper is motived by the fact that memory translation has become a major performance bottleneck on today's multicore
platform, where several TBs of memory on a single node is not uncommon.
Maintaining large working sets in the main memory requires proportionally more translation entries, as modern hardware 
still performs address translation in a fixed granularity.
