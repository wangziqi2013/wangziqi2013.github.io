This paper proposes Midgard, a novel virtual memory framework for reduced translation overhead on the critical path.
The paper is motived by the fact that memory translation has become a major performance bottleneck on today's multicore
platform, where several TBs of memory on a single node is not uncommon.
Maintaining large working sets in the main memory requires proportionally more translation entries, as modern hardware 
still performs address translation in a fixed granularity.
Unfortunately, the hardware structure for caching these entries for fast access, i.e., TLBs, cannot scale with the 
growth of working set size for various reasons. As a result, when the working set size exceeds the maximum coverage 
of the TLB, the MMU must frequently perform page walks to bring new translation entries into the TLB.
This is likely on the critical path, since memory instructions will remain in the ROB and/or various queues until
their addresses are resolved, which can potentially cause structural hazard to the following instructions.
