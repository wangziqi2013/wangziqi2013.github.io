This paper proposes dual-page checkpointing, a hardware checkpointing scheme based on fine-grained copy-on-write (COW)
with low metadata and storage overhead. The paper identifies the problems of two popular checkpointing schemes, logging
and coarse-grained Copy-on-Write, which we describe as follows. Logging requires the system to duplicate every memory
write to the NVM, one for in-place updates to the home location, another for generating log entries. Excessive NVM writes
are both slow and introduce wearing. Careful optimization may move the slow log entry write out of the critical path,
and only performs logging on the first write during an epoch, but still, the overhead of writing twice is non-negligible.
