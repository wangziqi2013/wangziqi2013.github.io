This paper proposes a compression-based bus transmission scheme for reducing the energy and power consumption while 
retaining the benefits of bandwidth reduction with compression. The paper points out that compression can reduce the 
bandwidth of data transmission over the system bus and inter-component links, which is especially effective for GPGPU,
since GPGPUs are more likely to be memory bound.
