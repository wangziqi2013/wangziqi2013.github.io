**Highlight:**

1. Good application of extendible hashing to NVM

2. I appreciate the simple persistence protocol of updating from right-to-left. This reminds me of the common technique
   that many NVM malloc uses -- storing size information in the block header, and walk the block headers in the recovery
   process.

**Lowlight**

1. This paper is extremely badly written. Grammar and explanations are bad. Examples are difficult to understand. The auhthors
   may want to improve the explanation of segment split a little as well as the recovery process. Also the paper should 
   make clear where the "local depth" is stored - directory or segment or per bucket?

This paper proposes Cache Line Conscious Extendible Hashing (CCEH), a dynamic hashing scheme for byte-addressable persistent 
memory.
