This paper proposes MemZip, an application of memory compression technique that aims at improving performance and power 
efficiency of the memory system. The paper points out at the beginning that most existing memory compression schemes aim
at improving storage efficiency via flexible allocation of variable sized pages and clever placement of data. These
schemes are not always optimal for several reasons. First, although cache lines become shorter bacause of compression,
the DRAM access protocol still bursts 64 bytes as in uncompressed memory, which over-fetches the line. The paper argues 
that over-fetching only makes sense if adjacent lines are also stored in compressed form together, and when access locality
is high. The second reason is that memory compression schemes often need to maintain large amount of metadata in order to
perform address remapping from uncompressed address space to compressed address space. Since compressed cache lines are 
no longer stored on their home addresses, metadata access must be serialized with data access, which are both on the critical
data access path.
