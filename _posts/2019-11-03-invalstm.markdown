This paper presents InvalSTM, an STM design based on forward optimistic co currency control (FOCC). The paper identifies
a few problems with commonly used concurrency scheme, BOCC, which is based on validation. First, BOCC only validates the 
committing transaction against committed transactions that can overlap its execution. If the write set of any of the 
overlapping transactions overlaps with the read set of the committing transaction, the latter has no choice but abort,
since otherwise we violate the commit order. One consequence of this process is that a writing transaction to address X
can abort all overlapping reading transactions on address X, making this scheme unfriendly for readers.
