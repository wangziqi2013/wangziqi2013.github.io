This paper presents Pacman, a software solution aiming at reducing the overhead of log-structure key-value store
running on Byte-Addressable Non-Volatile Memory (NVM). The paper is motivated by the uniformly high overhead of garbage 
collection in log-structured key-value store designs when they are deployed on NVM. The proposed software 
solution, Pacman, addresses the challenge by adopting special software techniques based on the performance 
characteristics of NVM devices. As a result, Pacman improves the operational throughput of key-value stores even
at high storage utilization.

The Pacman design is based on log-structured key-value stores where modifications to the existing key-value entries are 
implemented log appends of the newer key-value rather than in-place updates. As a result, there can be multiple 
versions of key-value entries
co-existing on the persistent storage.
