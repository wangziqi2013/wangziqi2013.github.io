This paper proposes SC2, a cache compression design taking advantage of Huffman encoding to achieve both high compression
ratio and low decompression latency. The paper observes that most conventional cache compression schemes suffer from low
compression ratio, since they typically trade-off decompression latency with the efficiency of the compression algorithm.
This paper, however, proposes that Huffman encoding be used as the compression and decompression algorithm, despite
the common knowledge that decompression with Huffman encoding is unsiutable for hardware compression.

The paper identifies two major challenges of using Huffman encoding with hardware cache compression. First, unlike dictionary
based encoding where the dictionary is derived from data that has already been decompressed, Huffman encoding requires 
a codebook be used as the reference during both encoding and decoding. The generation, maintenance and switching of the 
codebook pose a challenge, since the complexity of these operations just grows as the number of symbols become large.
