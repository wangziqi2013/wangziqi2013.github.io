**Lowlights:**

1. This paper is written badly, with lots of jargons and concepts unexplained (what are "elements"? It took me a while to 
   figure out that the authors are referring to terminal level values, which is to differentiate it from next-level inner
   nodes). I inferred most parts by guessing instead 
   of reading the actual text. Some terminologies are not used properly, such as "memorization", which is often used to
   refer to a programming technique that is used in top-down recursion.
   One example of bad grammar is on page 8, right below listing 6:
   "With MEMCHAMP we will refer throughout the text to the
    variant of CHAMP that adds memoized element hash codes,
    but drops incremental collection hash codes."
    Can you be more obsecure with this sentence structure?
