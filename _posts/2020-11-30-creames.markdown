This paper proposes CREAMES, a main memory compression solution for embedded systems where memory is a scarse
resource, while no disk is present as swap space. 
This paper points out that conventional solutions for main memory compression will not work on embedded platform,
since these prior solutions usually assume disks as the backing store of the virtual memory system.
The paper also lists five challenges for a main memory compression solution on embedded platforms. 
First, compressed and uncompressed memory region must be carefully maintained, such that the application will not
be terminted due to lack of usable memory. There is a trade-off: On one hand, if too much storage is dedicated
to storing compressed pages, application's memory allocation requests might fail, while the compression region still
has free space. On the other hand, if the compression region is too small, the overall compression ratio would be 
insignificant, limiting the effectiveness of compression.
