**Lowlight:**

1. There is no description on memory and bus compression. Even the cache compression scheme is an low effort one that
   is based on a previous design. What is the novelty of this paper?

This paper proposes ICC-C, a unified cache, bus and memory compression scheme. The paper summarizes previous works on 
cache, bus and memory compression as follows. First, cache compression helps in reducing SRAM access overhead for less
power consumption, or increasing effective cache size for better performance. Second, data transferred on the system bus
can also be encoded with frequent patterns. The sending end and receiving end both keep a dictionary whose contents are 
pre-synchronized to be consistent. Frequent patterns such as all-ones or all-zeros are encoded using dictionary codewords
to reduce the number of bits on the bus. Since these are common patterns for both address and data, bus compression also 
helps increasing effective bandwidth and reducing latency. Memory compression
