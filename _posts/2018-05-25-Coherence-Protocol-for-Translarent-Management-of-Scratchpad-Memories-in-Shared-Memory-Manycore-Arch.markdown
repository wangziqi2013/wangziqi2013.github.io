Scratchpad memory (SPM) is small and fast on-chip memory that allows easy accesses by applications. Compared 
with the cache hierarchy, SPM is nearly as fast, but is more power efficient. The biggest difference between
SPM and the cache is that SPM requires explicit software management in order to transfer and synchronize data,
while the cache hierarchy manages data in cache line granularity, and handles cache eviction and coherence.
