This paper proposes Set Balancing Cache (SBC), a technique that conditionally merges sets within a cache for better 
overall performance. The paper begins by pointing out that in current set-associative designs, sets are often not 
accessed with uniform probablity. In other words, some sets in the cache will receive significantly more activity than
the rest. Unfortunately, in set-associative caches, tags and data slots are statically allocated for each set, and 
there is no way to allieviate such imbalance by moving tags and data slots around. 

This paper seeks a new approach of balancing traffic between sets without introducing an extra level of indirection.
In a conventional cache, similar effect can be achieved by doubling the associativity of the cache while keeping total
number of data slots unchanged. This approach, however, has two major flaws. The first flaw is that for each cache 
access, no matter a hit or not, the number of tags that have to be read from the SRAM file also doubles, which consumes
2x the power than it used to. The second flaw is that by doubling the number of ways, we effectively merge two sets 
in the previous cache whose index only differs by the highest bit, i.e. one less bit is used to index the set in the 
new cache, and one more lower bit is used in the address tag. Such static mapping does not always fulfill our needs, 
since both sets can be busy, and merging them together does not really help.
