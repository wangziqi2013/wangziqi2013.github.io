This paper proposes Set Balancing Cache (SBC), a technique that conditionally merges sets within a cache for better 
overall performance. The paper begins by pointing out that in current set-associative designs, sets are often not 
accessed with uniform probablity. In other words, some sets in the cache will receive significantly more activity than
the rest. Unfortunately, in set-associative caches, tags and data slots are statically allocated for each set, and 
there is no way to allieviate such imbalance by moving tags and data slots around.
