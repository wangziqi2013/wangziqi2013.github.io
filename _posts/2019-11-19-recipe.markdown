This paper propes Recipe, a code transformation technique for implementing failure atomic persistent data structures
from their concurrent but non-persistent counterparts. The paper is motived by the fact that persistence and isolation
are, in fact, similar to each other since they both require that data structure be able to recognize partially updated
states, and fix them cooperatively during execution. In other words, most data structures require that operations
be atomic with regard to other concurrent operations. This can be achieved by making the changes publicly available
using one atomic step. In the meantime, if we need failure atomicity on data structure, they must commit all changes 
to the NVM and make them available to post-crash recovery routines in one atomic step, such that either all necessary
information is on the NVM for replay all the changes, or none of them is available after recovery.
