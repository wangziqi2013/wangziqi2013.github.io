This paper introduces Coroutines for Synchronous Persistence (COSPlay), a hardware-software co-design that exploits 
task-level parallelism from the software side, and virtualized write buffer on the hardware side, for improved 
persistence throughput. The paper is motivated by the fact that current support for persistence ordering on commercial 
processors is limited to per-core barriers that block all future store and flush operations while existing 
outstanding flushes are being served. This coarse-grained mechanism guarantees safety, but causes unnecessary 
pipeline stalls, since not all store and flush operations waiting to be executed are dependent on the current
persistent operation.
