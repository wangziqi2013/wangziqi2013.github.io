This paper presents UNITD, a unified mechanism for maintaining coherence for caches and the Translation-Lookaside Buffer 
(TLB) using the classical cache coherence infrastructure. Traditionally, TLB are not maintained coherent by the hardware,
unlike the cache. There are two reasons. The first is that although cache coherence are important in most cases, as data 
sharing between processors are very common, TLB entries, on the other hand, are only invalidated when the underlying page 
table entries (PTEs) are modified. Maintaining coherent TLB across processors hence may not justify extra hardware and 
design efforts in order to implement it.
