This paper presents FaaSCache, a caching policy for virtual machine keep-alive in multi-tenant environments containing
heterogeneous function instances. The paper is motivated by the fact that commercial cloud providers nowadays all
cache function instances on the worker node to alleviate the long cold start latency, which is incurred by the 
initialization cost of the container itself and the language runtime.
