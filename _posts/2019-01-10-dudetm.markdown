This paper proposes DudeTM, a persistent transactional memory design which guarantees not only atomicity, consistency, 
isolation, but also durability. DudeTM is built upon Non-Volatile Memory (NVM), where read latency is close or equal
to that of DRAM, and write operations are orders of magnitudes slower than reads. Another prominent feature of NVM
is that unlike hard disks where data can only be accessed by block I/O, NVM supports byte addressable, DRAM style 
accessing interface, making it an ideal replacement for DRAM modules when persistency is desired.
