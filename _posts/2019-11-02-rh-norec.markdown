This paper presents hardware NORec, a hybrid transactional memory design based on the lightweight NORec. The paper identifies
that some aspects in STM design will cause slowdown of execution, making single thread performance of STM several times slower
than non-instrumented execution. For example, NORec requires every transactional load and store be instrumented, in order 
to maintain a read and write set for the transaction. This causes notable instruction explosion and metadata overhead, which
decreases both the IPC due to excessive cache misses (both icache and dcache since instruction traces are also larger),
and instruction throughput. What is more, the conflict resolution protocol in NORec relies on a single atomic global counter
serving as the serialization point for concurrent transaction. A reader transaction must check the counter on every transactional
load to maintain opacity. If the check fails, meaning that the transaction may access inconsistent data, it must abort 
and retry.

Hardware NORec is based on NORec, a previously proposed pure software TM scheme. NORec eliminates the requirement for 
having a direct-mapped or hashed metadata field for every accessing unit (i.e. the unit of version management and conflict
detection) by using a global counter for serialization, and by using value validation.
