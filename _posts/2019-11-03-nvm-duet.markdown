This paper proposes NVM Duet, a software-hardware co-design that enables better write performance within NVM by using
more flexible scheduling and by taking advantage of the physical property. The discussion is based on byte addressable 
Phase Change Memory (PCM) installed to the memory bus, which can be accessed in cache line granularity via load 
and store instructions. The paper identifies two problems that result in prolonged write latency in current NVM architectures. 
The first problem is that writes are not always scheduled in an optimal manner given the hardware primitive for implementing
software persistence barriers. At the time of writing this paper, Intel has proposed using clflush (and later an optimized
form, clwb, is added to the ISA), sfence and pcommit (now deprecated) to force data to be written back into the NVM.
