**Lowlight:**

1. This design is really just a mixture of over-thinking and ad-hoc algorithms. I understand that the author
   may obtained the initial idea from software generational GC and felt motivated to port it to hardware. But really, GC
   and memory allocation is not a thing that you should perform purely on hardware. 
   Although the authors tried his best to make the design as flawless as possible, the inelegant ad-hoc and hardwired 
   logic and implicit assumptions make at least me uncomfortable when reading the paper.

This paper proposes Hotpads, an eccentric memory hierarchy architecture that optimizes for small object allocation, 
garbage collection in managed languages, memory safety, and reducing associative lookup costs in conventional cache
hierarchy.
