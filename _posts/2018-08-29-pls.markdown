Designing concurrent data structure is, in general, a difficult task. For small-scale applications, a single lock that 
blocks access to the entire object suffices. On large-scale data processing platforms with modern multicore architecture,
however, the overhead of inter-thread communication and the bottleneck of blocking render the simple approach unattractive.
Writing efficient concurrent data structures thus require a thorough understanding of the internals of the data structure,
as well as knowing the intrinsic level of parallelism of certain implementations.
