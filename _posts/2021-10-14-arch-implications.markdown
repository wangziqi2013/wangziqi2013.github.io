This paper presents benchmarking results of serverless applications. 
The paper is motivated by the question of whether today's commercial hardware is still a good fit for serverless
workloads, which demonstrate drastically different performance traits than traditional cloud applications.
The paper conducted experiments on real hardware platform with an open-source FaaS software package, and collected
performance statistics with hardware performance counters.
The paper concluded that today's processor design is not exactly optimal for serverless execution, and some 
hardware features need to be reconsidered in order to be fully exploited by serverless.
