This workshop paper presents OpenLambda, an open-source framework (under development when the paper was published) 
that implements the serverless paradigm as an experimental platform for serverless innovations.
The authors of the paper identifies a few features that are critical for performance and usability of the platform, 
and briefly discusses them as potential point of interests that can be implemented in OpenLambda.
