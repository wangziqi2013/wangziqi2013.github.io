### Introduction

The contribution calendar is one of the nicest things on Github profile page. For crazy coders
like many of my colleges, there is nothing more suitable to serve the purpose of
showing off their hard work and devotion into the great cause that we call "programming". 
This article aims at solving the problem of porting the dynamic Github contribution calendar
onto your personal static page. We use [Github page](https://pages.github.com/) (github.io domain)
as the platform of demonstration. A preview is given in Figure 1.
