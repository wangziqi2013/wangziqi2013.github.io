This paper proposes Pangolin, a software library providing redundancy and repairing capabilities to existing NVM libraries.
The paper identifies two causes of data corruptions in NVM-based systems. The first reason is hardware error, which can 
be either medium error, or faulty firmware. This type of error can be detected by internal ECC circult, which is reported
to the processor via interrupts. The second reason is software error, which happens when a bug in the library overwrites
a piece of memory it should not have modified. Such type of errors cannot be caught by hardware

This paper assumes that the underlying hardware may suffer from data corruption due to missing writes or faulty mapping 
hardware. The hardware provides error detection mechanism using ECC to .
