This paper presents a design for DRAM-based L4 cache implemented with Die-Stacked DRAM. Conventional DRAM is not suitable
for implementing any form of caching, because accessing the DRAM cache before going to the home location can only
increase latency in any situation. Die-Stacked DRAM, however, makes DRAM caching feasible due to its lower access latency.
Previous researches reported lower latency of Die-Stacked DRAM, ranging from half to one-fourth of the latency of conventional 
DRAM, which implies the possibility of using on-chip Die-Stacked DRAM to implement an additional L4 cache between the LLC
and conventional DRAM.

This paper pointed out, however, that due to the large size of DRAM caches, storing the tags can be difficult.
