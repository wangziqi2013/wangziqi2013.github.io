This paper proposes X-Match and X-RL, a memory compression and decompression algorithm with harrware implementation.
The paper identifies three major problems with previous software compression algorithms. First, traditional software
compression algorithms tend to introduce large data blowup at the initial stage of compression, since these algorithms
are designed for streams of large size, while memory compression works on smaller blocks.
