This paper proposes SuperMem, a hardware design optimized for counter mode encryption. This paper identifies a few problems
of existing counter mode encryption schemes. First, current hardware platform does not guarantee tha atomicity of persistence
for more than one cache line sized block, which introduces the problem of inconsistent data block and counter value. To solve
this issue, prior researches have proposed large battery-backed buffer on the memory controller to allow both the counter
and the block to be buffered, upgrading the basic unit of atomicity from one cache line to two cache lines. Such a design,
however, may significantly change the underlying hardware, or become difficult to implement within commercial systems.
