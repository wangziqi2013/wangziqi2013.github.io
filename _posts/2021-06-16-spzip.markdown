This paper proposes SpZip, a data-flow memory access architecture with compression for better cache and memory 
efficiency on irregular data structures and algorithms.
SpZip is motivated by two important observations.
First, many real world applications use sparse data structures in which most of the elements are of value zero,
and the data structure itself is stored in a compact format. As a result, these applications demonstrate irregular
access patterns over the address space. Pure software solutions that use manually crafted, ad-hoc routines to traverse 
these structure usually suffer from high cache misses due to software's inability to communicate the access pattern
to hardware.
