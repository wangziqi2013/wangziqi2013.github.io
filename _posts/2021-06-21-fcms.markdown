This paper proposes Fine-Grained Compressed Memory System (FCMS) as an improvement over a previous proposal SCMS.
The authors noted that while SCMS reduces memory bandwidth and effective cache capacity, the maximum compression
ratio is limited to two, due to the fact hat SCMS only compresses adjacent even-odd blocks into the same data slot.
