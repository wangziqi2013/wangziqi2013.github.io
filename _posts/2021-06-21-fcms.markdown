This paper proposes Fine-Grained Compressed Memory System (FCMS) as an improvement over a previous proposal SCMS.
The authors noted that while SCMS reduces memory bandwidth and effective cache capacity, the maximum compression
ratio is limited to two, due to the fact hat SCMS only compresses adjacent even-odd blocks into the same data slot.
The paper observes that with a moderately good compression algorithm, many cache blocks can be compressed to less
than 50% of the original size, which causes storage under-utilization, as blocks compressed to less than 50% 
of the original size will leave unused storage in the data slot (which is called internal fragmentation by this paper).

FCMS differs from SCMS by assigning multiple size classes to compressed blocks, rather than only having two 
(i.e., uncompressed, and half-sized). Compressed block sizes are assigned with different "size buckets". The paper
proposes using 16 buckets, meaning that for 64-byte cache blocks (the paper seems to suggest using 128-byte blocks,
but it does not affect our discussion), compressed blocks between size 4i and (4i + 3) will be assigned to bucket i.
Cache metadata is also organized such that compressed blocks can occupy a variable number of buckets in the data array,
allowing a more flexible management of cached data. 

FCMS is based on SCMS. SCMS is a unified compressed LLC and memory design, in which blocks are transferred between the
LLC and the DRAM in compressed form on block fetch and eviction. SCMS only attempts to compress adjacent even-odd 
blocks individually, and store them in the same 64-byte data slot.
