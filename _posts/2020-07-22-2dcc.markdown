This paper proposes Two-Dimentional Cache Compression, 2DCC, a cache compression design leveraging both intra-line and
inter-line redundancy. This paper begins by pointing out that both intra-line and inter-line redundancy exist in the
working set of typical workloads, as cache lines, as a whole, tend to contain similar to identical content in addition 
to the more classical redundancy between individual words within a line. Conventional cache compression schemes,
however, only takes advantage of intra-line dependency, since it is most natural to process individual lines rather 
than combing several lines together, as cache lines are the most fundamental unit of data communication between components
in the memory hierarchy. On the other hand, [prior LLC deduplication schemes]({% post_url 2020-06-24-llc-dedup %})
proposes LLC deduplication using a hash table to perform fast detection of duplicated blocks. This scheme does not 
benefit from intra-line redundancy, which is also suboptimal.
