This paper proposes ForgiveTM, a bounded HTM design that features lower abort rate than commercial HTMs. ForgiveTM 
reduces conflict aborts by leveraging the observation that the order of reads and writes within a transaction is 
irrelevant to the order that they are issued to the shared cache, as long as these reads and writes are committed atomically 
and that the coherence protocol provides most up-to-date lines for each request.
