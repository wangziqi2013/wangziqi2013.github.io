This paper proposes Typed Architecture, an enhancement to low-power IoT and embedded processors that enables efficient
type checking and operand dispatching on hardware.
The paper is motivated by the fact that current commercial platforms for low-power applications run scripted languages
such as Lua, Python, or Javascript for their fast deployment capabilities and ease of development.
