This paper proposes Page Size Propagation Module (PPM), an extension to the existing spatial cache prefetchers that
enables prefetching on 2MB huge pages. The paper was motivated by the fact that 2MB huge pages are prevalent in 
most workloads, but the existing spatial prefetchers cannot prefetch across the regular 4KB page boundary.
