This paper proposes C-Pack, a cache compression architecture featuring realistic design assumptions and validiation steps
that actually fit into processor's design flow. The paper points out that existing cache compression algorithms either make 
unrealistic assumptions about the design complexity or compression/decompression latency, making the algorithm difficult 
to implement and deploy. In addition, some design algorithms are designed to work well with large blocks in order to
find sufficient number of patterns, which may not work well with 64 byte cache lines, and often requires an extra indirection
or caching level.

The paper consists of two parts. The first part discusses the hardware implemented compression algorithm, which is a 
hybrid of pattern-based encoding and dictionary-based compression (like LZW). The second part of the paper discusses
the compressed cache organization, which uses a restricted tag mapping scheme to achieve low cost cache management.
