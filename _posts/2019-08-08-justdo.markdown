This paper proposes JUSTDO logging, a novel logging and recovery method for non-volatile memory. In ordinary logging schemes,
such as undo logging, redo logging, and shadow logging, the amount of data (i.e. log records and metadata) is proportional
to the number of store operations. One log entry is generated for each store operation, which contains the address, data,
and other control information in order to roll back or redo the affected region. These schemes generally have two problems.
