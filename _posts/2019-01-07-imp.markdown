This paper proposes Indirect Memory Prefetcher (IMP) to address the common problem of slow indirect memory operations. 
Indirect memory operations are of the form A\[B\[i\]\], where B\[i\] is an array of indices that are read and used 
with a regular pattern, and A\[i\] stores data which are often accessed without a pattern. This scenario is common in 
compressed representation of sparse data structures, where the array B stores the index of entries that have a non-zero
value, and array A stores the actual non-zero value
