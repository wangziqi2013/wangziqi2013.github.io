This paper proposes ATOM, an undo-based design for achieving atomic persistency. Atomic persistency is a programming paradigm
in which programmers specify an atomic region, and either all updates within the region are persisted, or none of them is 
persisted, similar to how atomicity is defined for transactions. Atomic persistency is often implemented in software using 
undo logging. Before a data item is written, code must be inserted to. Programmers manually issue persistence barriers consisting of cache line write back instructions and memory 
fences to flush dirty data items back to the NVM.

This paper identifies two potential write ordering
