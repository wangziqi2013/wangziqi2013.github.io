Dynamic Indexing Cache Compression (DICE) is a technique designed to increase the bandwidth of the 
DRAM cache. Traditional algorithms of cache compression focus mainly on reducing the storage of 
a cache line by taking advantage of data patterns. This can indeed increase the cache hit rate for smaller
L1 and L2 caches, because more lines can be stored without the cost of larger SRAM. For DRAM caches, however,
compressing for capacity may not bring as much benefit as it would for smaller caches. First, DRAM caches 
are typically few hundreds megabytes or even gigabytes in size. Increasing the size of the DRAM cache by compressing 
lines has only marginal effect on the hit rate. Second, DRAM cache is more flexible than SRAM cache as it stores both 
tags and lines in DRAM array. It is hence easier for the cache controller to alter the storage format of compressed lines.
In SRAM this is impossible as extra tag arrays must be added.
