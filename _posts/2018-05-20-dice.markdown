Dynamic Indexing Cache Compression (DICE) is a technique designed to increase the bandwidth of the 
DRAM cache. Traditional algorithms of cache compression focus mainly on reducing the storage of 
a cache line by taking advantage of data patterns. This can indeed increase the cache hit ratio for smaller
L1 or L2 caches, because more lines can be stored without the cost of larger SRAM.
