This paper proposes SpecFaaS, a function-as-a-service (FaaS) framework that enables the speculative execution of 
functions to speed up chained invocation. SpecFaaS is motivated by the high degree of both control and data 
determinism during chained invocation, i.e., with high probabilities, chained function execution will
follow the same path given the same invocation history, and the outputs of a single function will be identical
given the same inputs.
