This paper introduces AsymNVM, a distributed shared NVM storage architecture. AsymNVM is motivated by asymmetric NVM architecture,
where NVM storage backends are decoupled from the computation frontend. AsymNVM points out that by decoupling NVM storage node
from the computation node, conventional logging approaches are no longer feasible, due to increased communication
latency. Write ordering, which is essential to logging-based persistence algorithms, requires flushing a cache line to 
the backend NVM, and waiting for the response over the network, taking at least one round-trip delay to complete.
