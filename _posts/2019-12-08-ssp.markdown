This paper proposes SSP, a hardware framework for achieving persistent transactions on byte-addressable non-volatile 
memory system. The paper points out that existing software schemes, such as logging, shadow mapping, and log-structured
update, are all inefficient in terms of both latency and throughput. For example, in the most two common logging schemes,
redo logging and undo logging, old or new data must be written and flushed back to the NVM before the corrsponding location 
can be updated in-place to avoid dirty data cache line being evicted back to the NVM before the log entries are persisted. 
This introduces two problems. The first problem is write amplification, since data is written twice (if we consider 
metadata writes and log truncation overhead, the overhead is even larger).
