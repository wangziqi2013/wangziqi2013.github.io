This paper presents Ripple, a novel instruction cache replacement algorithm using off-line optimality analysis.
The paper is motivated by the fact that modern data center applications can incur a heavy burden on the instruction
cache, which is caused by numerous software stacks and many modules for different purposes within each stack.
