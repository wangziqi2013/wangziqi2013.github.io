This paper proposes RRIP, a machanism for determining whether a cache line should be replaced 
by predicting the interval from the current time till its next reference. The motivation for 
RRIP is locality anomaly, which is not uncommon for lower level caches, such as L2 and LLC.
The classical Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm works pretty well, sometimes can approximate the 
optimizal Belady's OPT algorithm, for access patterns that have high locality, which is particularly 
true for L1 cache. On L2 and LLC, LRU may not work well for three reasons. First, most of the locality
has been filtered out by L1, and only those misses the L1 cache can be observed by L2 and LCC. This 
property violates the assumption of LRU that both a cache miss and cache hit imply accesses to the 
same line in the near future.
