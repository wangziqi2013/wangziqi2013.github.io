This paper proposes a compressed NVM architecture for better wear-leveling using frequent value compression.
The paper identifies one of the most important issue with NVM is that its lifetime is not infinite, which actually
has limited write-erase cycles. Without proper management, frequently written cells will wear out fast (in a matter
of days), rendering the entire device unusable.
Another minor issue is that NVM write energy is much larger than DRAM. Reducing the number of bits written into
the device, therefore, becomes critical for energy consumption.
