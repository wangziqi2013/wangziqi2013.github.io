This paper introduces SoftWaRP, a software framework that supports atomic transactions on NVM. The paper sets the goal
of SoftWaRP as providing durability and atomicity to user applications in a system equipped with NVM. Without special
support, neither durability and atomicity is supported by the naive memory interface of NVM devices. On one hand, 
dirty data written by store instructions will be buffered by the cache hierarchy, which may not reach the NVM before
a crash. On the other hand, uncontrolled, arbitrary evictions can also happen during the execution of a transaction, breaking 
atomicity if data is only partially updated when a crash happens.
