This paper presents ResPCT, a software epoch-based non-volatile memory snapshotting framework. ResPCT protects 
the integrity of shared data from system failures by periodically checkpointing the states of variables to the NVM.
To maximize performance while minimizing programmer effort, ResPCT adopts in-cache line undo logging and leverages
programmers' notations to mark checkpoint boundaries. ResPCT achieves only marginal performance loss while 
providing the benefit of failure atomicity. Compared with prior works, ResPCT also achieves a significant reduction
in runtime overhead due to its in-cache line logging model.

ResPCT aims to provide an epoch-based checkpointing model for lock-based data structures. In the epoch-based model,
the multithreaded execution is divided into non-disjoint intervals, called epochs, and the state of shared data
is persisted to the NVM at the end of an epoch and before the next one starts. On crash recovery, the system finds
the latest persisted epoch and then restores the system state to the one recorded by that epoch. 
In the case of multithreaded applications
ResPCT assumes that the application periodically creates a checkpoint using an interface function it provides.
ResPCT also assumes that the application programmer can explicitly mark the Restart Points (RP) to which the system 
state can potentially be restored. For common use cases such as data structures, the RPs can be easily identified
at some points in the code region that is not within a critical section (as the code within critical sections will 
mutate shared data and leave it in a temporarily inconsistent state). 
Currently, ResPCT only supports critical section-based use cases. Lock-free data structures, for example, are not 
supported because ResPCT's internal logging API is not safe for concurrent invocations.
