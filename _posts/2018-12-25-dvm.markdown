This paper proposes Devirtualized Memory (DVM), which aims at providing high memory bandwidth to accelerators that
can access virtual address space. This is crucial for improving the usability and efficiency of accelerators 
such as GPUs for three reasons. First, accelerators need to access virtual memory for better protection and resource 
multiplexing. The virtual memory protection bits and remapping fits into this perfectly. Second, if accelerators could 
access the virtual memory as the CPU does, then a pointer on the CPU has the same meaning on the accelerator. Pointer
based data structures, such as linked lists, trees and graphs, can be transferred between CPU and accelerator directly without
data marshalling and unmarshalling.
