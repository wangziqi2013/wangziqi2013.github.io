This paper presents an improved Java Garbage Collection (GC) algorithm optimized for Byte-Addressable Non-Volatile
Memory (NVM). The paper is motivated by the performance degradation of Java's default GC algorithm when deployed
on NVM due to NVM's low write bandwidth, especially under random I/O. The proposed algorithm transforms the read/write
pattern of GC, which contains excessive small writes and has bad locality, into large, sequential writes by
leveraging DRAM as an intermediate buffer. Consequently, higher performance can be achieved with the improved algorithm
as GC utilizes NVM more efficiently and hence constitute fewer cycles on the execution critical path.
