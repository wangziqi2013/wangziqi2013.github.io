This paper proposes Dictionary Sharing (DISH), a novel dictionary-based cache line compression scheme with high compression
ratio and low design cost. This paper identifies several issues with previous compressed cache proposals, such as DCC, 
SCC and YACC. First, to simplify storage management within a physical slot, these designs mandate that all cache lines
that share a physical slot must be from the same super block, and must be of the same size class after compression. 
Under such restriction, even if a physical slot still has storage for one compressed line, if the size class of the line
does not match the size class of the slot, the line cannot be stored, casuing space wastage. In the worse case, N tags
have to be allocated for lines in the same super block, if these
