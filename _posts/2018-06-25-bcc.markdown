Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) is favored on modern hardware over traditional Tow-Phase Locking (2PL)
for its high degree of parallelism and lower communication overhead between processors. OCC features a three 
phased transaction execution. In the first phase, the read phase, transactions optimistically read data items
without global state modification, and buffer writes in their local storage. Buffered write operations are called 
"pre-write", and these pre-writes will not be made public until the later commit phase. Transactions may read
inconsistent data items should other transactions commit during their read phases. The original OCC algorithm
does not try to address this problem, and implicitly assumes that inconsistent data will only affect the write set,
but never the control flow.
