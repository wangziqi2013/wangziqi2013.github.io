This paper proposes in-SRAM data compression, a novel cache compression technique that leverages the 
physical organization of SRAM storage elements to perform compression and indexing of compressed data.
The paper is motivated by the fact that most existing cache compression designs only treat the data array
as a scratchpad, and base the design on such an abstraction. In reality, however, the cache's data array
is not a flat storage structure, but instead, consists of smaller units that can be separately addressed
and may share control and/or data signal. 
The storage organization of caches can complicate a seemingly simple design using the flat storage abstraction,
because data is indexed in a particular pattern that may or may not be compatible with the access pattern
required by the compressed cache.
Besides, in these designs, the unit of compression is typically cache blocks. If a cache block is 
compressed using another block as the reference, then both blocks must be fetched and decompressed 
at access time. Both operations will incur extra latency on the read critical path, and as a result,
the benefits of compression diminish.

This paper proposes a different way of performing compression, which builds compression and decompression 
logic within the SRAM access logic. Besides, the unit of compression is designed in a way that is consistent
with the granularity of storage and data indexing, which both simplifies the design, and allows finer grained 
compression.

The compression design is based on the last-level cache organization in Xeon processor, which we describe as follows.
In Xeon, the LLC is partitioned into slices by cache sets, and each core has its own slice.
Each cache slice can be considered as a separate cache in our context, because each slide has its own storage 
elements and access logic.
Each way of a slice is implemented as a column, which contains all sets in that way, and each column is 
divided into four banks. 
Bank operate independently from each other, and each bank has its own access logic, which can read or write 
64 bit data on the data bus in a single cycle. Banks on the same index from different ways share a data bus.
Overall, the cache slide has four 64-bit data buses, shared among banks from different ways.
Given a set index generated by the cache controller, and a way index generated by the tag comparison logic,
the four banks from the selected way operate in parallel to access 256 bit data in a single cycle. 
The full 512-bit cache block is therefore accessed in two cycles by alternating the signal that 
specifies the lower or the upper half of the cache block to be accessed.
Note that since all banks on the same index from different ways share the same control signal and data bus,
at most one way (i.e., the selected way) can be active at a given time.

As mentioned earlier, the 512-bit cache block is stored in four banks, and each bank is responsible for 
128-bit of data. 
Within a bank, the 128-bit data is stored as two 64-bit words in two separate SRAM arrays. 
Each SRAM array stores the 64-bit word for all sets in the slice, and they operate in parallel.
Unfortunately, since the data bus per array is only 64 bits in width, only half of the word from each 
array will be read on each access.
The cache controller, therefore, must also generate an extra signal to specify whether to read the 
upper half or lower half in the current access cycle. 
When the set index is given, and the array is selected, each array will read either the high 32 bits 
or low 32 bits from the corresponding location indicated by set index, and then the result will be
concatenated and sent to the 64-bit data bus.
**Note:** The above description simplifies the actual implementation. In the actual implementation, one 
single SRAM unit may not be able to hold a 64-bit word for all sets. In this case, more than one SRAM array
is employed, and set index is further decoded into an array selection and offset within the selected array.
The paper uses an example with 256 * 256 bit array, where the row size is 512, and each row stores a 64-bit
word for four sets, and each array can store data for 1024 sets.
The slice, however, consists of 2048 sets, meaning that two arrays are needed for 64-bit words on all sets, and
each bank actually consists of four SRAM arrays.

In the baseline settings as described above, the physical location of each 64-bit word in a cache block 
is uniquely determined by the set index, which is generated using the physical address, and the way number, 
which is generated by tag comparison.
