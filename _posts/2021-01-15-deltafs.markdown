This workshop paper introduces DeltaFS, a distributed file system design for extremely high scalability without
dedicated metadata servers. The paper observes in the beginning that existing distribuyted systems for HPC workloads
often lack scalability due to dedicated metadata servers, which must be contacted on file system operations. The
consistency of the global metadata store also requires extra protocol overhead, which is most likely unnecessary,
since most workloads running on HPC clusters either do not communicate with each other, only using the file system
as a large, persistent store of data, or only communicate with other processes using a small portion of the file system.
In either case, maintaining a globally consistent image of file system metadata and sharing them among all processes
seems to be an overly strong semantics, as it will not be needed for most of the time.
