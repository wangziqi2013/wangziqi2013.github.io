This paper proposes a distributed concurrency control protocol that uses interval-based validation. In such a system, 
transactions are logically ordered by timestamps, which are integers whose value denote the serialization order of
transactions. Each transaction in the system has two timestamps: A lower bound (lb) which represents the lowest time the 
transaction could commit, and correspondingly a higher bound (ub) which represents the largest time the 
transaction could commit. As the transaction reads or writes data items, the CC manager must
