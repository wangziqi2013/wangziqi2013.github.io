This paper proposes Linearly Compressed Pages (LCP), a main memory compression framework featuring easy algorithm design,
low-cost deployment, and memory management. Broadly speaking, main memory compression schemes exist to satisfy one or both 
of the two goals.
The first goal is to reduce memory usage by allowing cache lines or pages to be packed in a more compact form after 
compression. This way less physical memory can be allocated to a full 4KB page frame, and hence more pages can be mapped
into virtual memory at the same time. The second
