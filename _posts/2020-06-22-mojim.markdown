This paper proposes Mojim, an NVM-based replication scheme featuring both high performance and reliability. The paper begins
by identifying the problem with current replication schemes based on disks. These schemes often assume a disk access latency
that is order of magnitudes larger than DRAM. The resulting design considers less about the effect of performance impact 
with the presence of software overhead, network stack overhead, and network roundtrip latency. In the NVM-era, as the 
speed of NVM is comparable or even close to that of DRAM, the system becomes more sensitive to software and network
overhead, suffering performance degradation if not tuned specifically for NVM.

Mojim solves the above challenge using a combination of high-bandwidth network with RDMA interface, simpler replicating
protocols with redo logging, and different levels of consistency between the master working copy and the mirrored copy.
First, with high bandwidth interlink between the master and the mirror, the network latency can be reduced to a minimum,
resulting in less blocks of the application. In addition, by using RDMA interface, rather than TCP or any buffered network
interface, no extra software buffering is used for data transfer between the master and the mirror, reducing software 
buffering and data movement overhead to a minimum. The RDMA device could directly fetch cache-coherence data from the 
hardware cache, without enforcing a software write back and possibly blocking on the operation.
With simpler replication protocol, the data exchange between master and mirror copy is as simple as master sending the 
log entries to the mirror, and the mirror acknowledgment of tansmission completion. No complicated two-phase 
commit is used, since only one mirror copy is present.
