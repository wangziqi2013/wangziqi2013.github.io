This paper proposes Mojim, an NVM-based replication scheme featuring both high performance and reliability. The paper begins
by identifying the problem with current replication schemes based on disks. These schemes often assume a disk access latency
that is order of magnitudes larger than DRAM. The resulting design considers less about the effect of performance impact 
with the presence of software overhead, network stack overhead, and network roundtrip latency. In the NVM-era, as the 
speed of NVM is comparable or even close to that of DRAM, the system becomes more sensitive to software and network
overhead, suffering performance degradation if not tuned specifically for NVM.
