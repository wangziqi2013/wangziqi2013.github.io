This paper presents benchmarking results on three serverless platforms and the performance and security implications
of these results. The paper's experiments consist of various tests and functional benchmarks, and reveals 
several critical design decisions and performance characteristics of serverless platforms that were never made public 
to users. The paper serves as both a comprehensive user experience report, providing valuable insights for peer 
serverless function developers to plan and optimize accordingly, and as a guideline for future iterations of these
platforms.
