This paper introduces Pinnacle, a memory controller module designed for Pentium and Xeon platform featuring main memory
compression. It implements IBM MXT memory compression technology, which supports upto 2x storage reduction and a
maximum of 64:1 compression on certain contents. As pointed out at the beginning of this paper, Pinnacle makes a trade-off
between access latency and greater functionality. 

Pinnacle supports a memory hierarchy consisting of multiple cores, private L1, L2 caches, and a shared Last-Level Cache 
(LLC). The memory controller sits between the LLC and the memory modules, which also participates in cache coherence by 
snooping on the system bus. Pinnacle internally distinguishes between the conventional physical address space after
MMU translation and the actual hardware address on DRAM modules. The former is called as "real address space", while the 
latter is called "physical address space". In the following discussion, we adhere to these terms and their definitions.

Cache lines are stored in compressed form on the DRAM. They are decompressed when they are fetched into a special cache 
maintained by the Pinnacle controller itself, and compressed again when evicted. The organization of the cache will
be discussed below. 
Pinnacle assumes a 2:1 compression ratio in average, although in best cases it could compress a line to 1/64-th of 
the original size.
At system startup time, after memory check passes, the BIOS configures the actual physical DRAM to be 
twice as large as the actual DRAM installed on the system. This creates an illusion to all upper level software, includng
the OS, that the actual amount of usable RAM is doubled. The OS, however, should also be slightly modified such that
the virtual memory manager does not over-commit physical memory when the average compression ratio is below 2:1, which 
is can be a fatal error which crashes the system.
