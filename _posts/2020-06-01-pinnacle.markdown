This paper introduces Pinnacle, a memory controller module designed for Pentium and Xeon platform featuring main memory
compression. It implements IBM MXT memory compression technology, which supports upto 2x storage reduction and a
maximum of 64:1 compression on certain contents. As pointed out at the beginning of this paper, Pinnacle makes a trade-off
between access latency and greater functionality.
