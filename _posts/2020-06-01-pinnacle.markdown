This paper introduces Pinnacle, a memory controller module designed for Pentium and Xeon platform featuring main memory
compression. It implements IBM MXT memory compression technology, which supports upto 2x storage reduction and a
maximum of 64:1 compression on certain contents. As pointed out at the beginning of this paper, Pinnacle makes a trade-off
between access latency and greater functionality. 

Pinnacle supports a memory hierarchy consisting of multiple cores, private L1, L2 caches, and a shared Last-Level Cache 
(LLC). The memory controller sits between the LLC and the memory modules, which also participates in cache coherence by 
snooping on the system bus. Pinnacle internally distinguishes between the conventional physical address space after
MMU translation and the actual hardware address on DRAM modules. The former is called as "real address space", while the 
latter is called "physical address space". In the following discussion, we adhere to these terms and their definitions.
