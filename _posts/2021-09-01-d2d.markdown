This paper proposes Direct-to-Data (D2D) cache, a cache hierarchy architecture that gets rid of the conventional
tag array and uses centralized repository for cache block location lookup. 
This paper is based on a previous work on tag-less L1 cache, which can be found [here]({% post_url 2021-08-23-tlc%}).
The D2D cache adopts the idea of tag-less L1 cache that extends the TLB as page-sized super-block tag array, and 
applies the same design philosophy to the remaining levels of the cache hierarchy, seeking to remove the tag 
array entirely for all cache components.
To achieve this, the D2D cache adds a few extra hardware components that track not only the location of a block in the 
L1, but also the location in the hierarchy and the sharing status.

The D2D cache is developed based on Tag-Less Cache (TLC), which is motived by the fact that both tag array lookup 
and parallel data array read consumes a significant portion of energy of an L1 cache. 
This is, however, unavoidable in a tag-based cache, since the block can be stored in any of the ways within a set.
The TLC design, on the other hand, proposes that the way number and validity status be tracked by the TLB, essentially
decoupling the tag and data array, and treating the TLB as a page-sized super-block tag array.
