This paper proposes Direct-to-Data (D2D) cache, a cache hierarchy architecture that gets rid of the conventional
tag array and uses centralized repository for cache block location lookup. 
This paper is based on a previous work on tag-less L1 cache, which can be found [here]({% post_url 2021-08-23-tlc%}).
