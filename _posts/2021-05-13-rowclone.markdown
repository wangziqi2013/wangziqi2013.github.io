This paper proposes RowClone, a fast data copy and initialization mechanism built into DRAM chips.
The paper points out that, on current memory architecture, data copy and initialization (specifically, zeroing out
a block) are two of the most commonly performed tasks, but yet very little optimizations exist.
On most platforms, these two tasks are performed by having the processor issuing instructions to fetch data into
the hierarchy, and then write it back to a different location. Some implementations optimize this using special
instructions provided by the ISA for this exact purposes. 
Two possible optimizations exist on today's x86. The first one is SIMD instructions, with which more than 64 bit
data can be read from the an address into an SIMD register, and written to another address. 
In addition, with non-temporal loads and stores, these instructions may bypass the cache hierarchy, and 
directly access DRAM to avoid cache pollution and the extra overhead of cache flushing.
