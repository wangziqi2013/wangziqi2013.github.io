**Note: Source code of SimPoints is available, which contains the full implementation, and should serve as the ultimate
source of reference. This paper summary is merely based on what was written on the published paper, not on what is in
the code repo (things might have changed, or the author did not give full clarification to certain details)**

**Lowlight:**

1. Basic blocks that are dynamically recognized at early stages of execution may be split to smaller blocks later, due 
   to a jump to the middle. Such jumps cannot be detected before they are actually executed, since SimPoints is 
   execution-driven. Even worse, for branches whose target address is dynamically generated during execution, even
   full static analysis cannot find the destination.
   How does SimPoints handle such casesï¼Ÿ

This paper introduces SimPoints, a simulation tool for accelerating architecture simulation using basic block vectors.
SimPoints aims at solving the problem of architectural simulation, especially cycle-accurate simulation, taking too much 
time to finish on typical full-scale workloads.
