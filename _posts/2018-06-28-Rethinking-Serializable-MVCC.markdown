Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) is a natural way of implementing Snapshot Isolation (SI),
because taking snapshots at the beginning of a transaction is almost free. Transactions acquire
a begin timestamp (bt) before they perform the first operation, and optionally also acquire a 
commit timestamp (ct) after the last operation in order to commit. Read operations take place 
by traversing the version chain of the data item
