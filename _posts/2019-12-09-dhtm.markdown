This paper proposes DHTM, a hardware transactional memory scheme that supports durable transactions. This paper begins by
identifying the challenge of implementing HTM with durability support as efficient logging. Software logging does not work
with HTM since current commercial HTM implementation will immediately abort when a cache line flush instruction evicts dirty
data to the NVM. Naive hardware logging, such as LogTM, does not work well for NVM as well, since its abort and commit 
latency will be much longer on NVM compared with DRAM-based implementation.
