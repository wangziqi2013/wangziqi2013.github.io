This paper presents SPHT, a durable hardware transactional memory design that achieves high scalability.
The paper recognizes three major difficulties in designing a durable TM. The first difficulty is atomicity of
transactions in volatile memory, which must be enforced by some volatile TM subsystems. 
Two options are available: STM and HTM. The issue, however, is that STM will incur non-negligible instrumentation
and metadata overhead, which harms overall performance especially when transactions are short.
HTM, on the other hand, is largely free of runtime overheads for ensuring atomicity. Their flexibility, however,
is inferior compared with STM, as most commercial HTM implementations nowadays will not allow a cache line to be flushed
out of the cache during transaction, which will result in an immediate abort.
