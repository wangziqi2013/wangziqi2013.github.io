This paper presents Record-and-Prefetch (REAP), a lightweight software mechanism for accelerating cold start from a 
VM image of serverless functions. The paper is motivated by the slowdown caused by frequent page faults and irregular
disk accesses when starting a new serverless instance from a prior snapshot on the disk. 
The paper observes that most function instances access a very stable subset of the working data that is in the snapshot,
and proposes to first track, and then prefetch those data pages in advance at VM start time to reduce the page 
fault handling and disk access overhead.

The cold start latency has become a well-known problem for serverless VMs, and it consists of three causes: The 
VMM itself, the kernel and runtime environment, and the function's own initialization.
Cold start latency complicates the management of serverless clouds for a few reasons. 
First, serverless functions are only billed for the actual time it takes to execute the function body. By spending
time on cold start for every function invocation, the cloud provider is essentially wasting hardware resource on 
computations that do not generate profit.
