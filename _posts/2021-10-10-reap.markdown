This paper presents Record-and-Prefetch (REAP), a lightweight software mechanism for accelerating cold start from a 
VM image of serverless functions. The paper is motivated by the slowdown caused by frequent page faults and irregular
disk accesses when starting a new serverless instance from a prior snapshot on the disk.
