This preprint draft paper presents several performance characteristics of the newly introduced commercial product of 
byte-addressable NVM, 3D XPoint. The observations made in this paper are based on actual physical persistent NVM hardware, 
which is most likely implemented with Phase-Change Memory technology. Byte-addressable NVM requires special support
from the integrated memory controller on the processor chip to ensure the correctness of stores once they reach
the write pending queue of the memory controller. The memory controller leverages Asynchronous DRAM Refresh capability
to guarantee that even on a power failure, dirty data in the write queue can still be flushed back to the NVM, and so does
dirty data within NVM's internal buffers and queues.
