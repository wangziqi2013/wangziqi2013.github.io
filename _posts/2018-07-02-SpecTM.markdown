Software Transactional Memory (STM) has long been rumored as being slow and useless as only a "research toy". The slowness
of STM for general purpose code inhibits its ability to serve as a build block for larger systems such as efficient parallel 
data structures and database transaction processing engine. The major factors that make STM slow can be summarized as 
follows. First, unlink Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) where the data cache and on-chip buffers serve as a limited 
storage of transaction metadata, STM must keep all metadata by itself with pure software approach. To work with potentialy
unbounded transactions, STM must support metadata of arbitrary size, which usually requires an auxiliary lookup structure
such as a hash table or per-item annotation for every transactional object. Neither of these is fast and scalable.
