This paper proposes PMEM-Spec, a hardware mechanism for enforcing strict write ordering between the memory consistency
model and NVM device. 
The paper points out that write ordering is critical for NVM-related programming, since the order of memory operations
performed on the hierarchy often differs from the order that NVM device sees them. This is caused by the fact that the
cache hierarchy can arbitrarily evict blocks back to the NVM, while programmers have only very limited control over the
lifespan of blocks in the hierarchy.
