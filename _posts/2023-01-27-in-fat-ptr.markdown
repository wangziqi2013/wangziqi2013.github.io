This paper proposes In-fat pointer, a hardware-software pointer tagging scheme that protects applications from spatial
memory errors caused by pointer-related bugs. In-fat pointer leverages the higher unused bits in virtual address 
pointers and embeds object bound and layout information to help specialized hardware check the validity of the 
pointer when the pointers are dereferenced.
Compared to prior works, in-fat pointer achieves a stronger protection guarantee which is at sub-object level 
without incurring high hardware and software overhead.
