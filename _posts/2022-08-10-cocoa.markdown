This paper proposes Synergistic Cache Compression and Error Correction (Cocoa), a technique that enables the LLC
to operate under low voltage while maintaining low error rate.
Cocoa is motivated by the power benefit of operating caches on low voltages, at the cost of increased error rate.
Cocoa addresses the issue with extra error correction and detection code stored in a few dedicated way of the 
data array.
To counter the performance degradation caused by a smaller data array for strong data, cache compression is 
applied to the rest of the ways such that more logic blocks can be stored in compressed form.
The resulting design enables the LLC to operate at a much lower voltage with low error rate, hence harvesting
the power benefit, without hurting performance.
