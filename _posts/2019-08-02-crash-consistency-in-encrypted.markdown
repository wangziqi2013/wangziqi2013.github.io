This paper introduces counter-atomicity, a concept used for encrypted NVM environment. The paper builds upon the fact
that data stored in NVM devices should be encrypted, because otherwise data can be accessed even after a system shutdown,
rendering memory protection meaningless. This paper levarages counter mode encryption, in which each cache line is tagged 
with a run-time generated counter. On every modification of the line, a new counter is generated by incrementing a system-wide 
hardware counter. Then a one-time padding is generated as a function of the counter. This process does not require cache 
line data, which is one of the reasons counter mode encryption can be implemented efficiently. After generating the one-time
padding, it is XOR'ed with the content of the line, which concludes the encryption process. Both the counter and the cache 
line are stored in the NVM in two different address spaces. On NVM read operation, both the counter and data are read
from their storage locations. The one-time padding is generated using the same function as in the encryption phase, and then
XOR'ed with the cache line data read from the NVM device. Since two XOR operations with the same mask will cancel out with 
each other, the original data can be recovered this way.
