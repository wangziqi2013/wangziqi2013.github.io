This paper presents BzTree, a lock-free and persistent B+Tree data structure designed for hybrid DRAM and NVM systems.
This paper identifies two atomicity requirements for in-memory B+Tree typically used as database indices. First, multi-step
updates should be atomic with regard to other threads. This avoids exposing some inconsistent intermedaite states to other
threads which may lead to data corruption or program failure. Second, multi-step updates should be atomic with
regard to the NVM. Either none of the operations or all of them should be reflected on the NVM image at any point during
the execution. Currently hardware primitives are insufficient to guarantee any of these two, with reliable progress guarantee
(HTM can satisfy the first requirement, but there is no progress guarantee unless a software fall back path is provided).
