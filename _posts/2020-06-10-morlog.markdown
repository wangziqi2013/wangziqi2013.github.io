This paper proposes MorLog, a hardware logging scheme for providing atomic persistence to transactional NVM systems. 
Conventional undo and redo logging suffers from performance overhead from several aspects. First, undo logging requires 
enforing the write ordering between log entries and data on the same address, which would require eagerly flushing undo 
log entries before data is written in the cache, given that the cache controller may write back the cache line any monent 
after it becomes dirty. In addition, undo logging requires that dirty data be persisted on the NVM before a transaction 
commits, which can cause long commit latency. On the other hand,
