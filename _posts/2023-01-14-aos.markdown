This paper proposes Always-On Memory Safety (AOS), a software-hardware mechanism for ensuring memory access integrity
by embedding bound information in unused bits of virtual address pointers. The design is motivated by the existing 
memory safety mechanism in ARM ISA and further extends the ISA to support integrity check of heap memory accesses. 
Compared with prior works, AOS minimizes the overhead of memory safety checking by performing them on hardware and 
by using relatively simpler addressing schemes for memory bound metadata.
