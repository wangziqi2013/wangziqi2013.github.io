This paper proposes Always-On Memory Safety (AOS), a software-hardware mechanism for ensuring memory access integrity
by embedding bound information in unused bits of virtual address pointers. The design is motivated by the existing 
memory safety mechanism in ARM ISA and further extends the ISA to support integrity check of heap memory accesses. 
Compared with prior works, AOS minimizes the overhead of memory safety checking by performing them on hardware and 
by using relatively simpler addressing schemes for memory bound metadata.

The paper is motivated by the increasingly obvious trend that heap attacks have become the mainstream of memory
safety attack due to the effectiveness of protection methods against stack-based attacks. In particular, the paper
named three heap-based attacks that are rapidly gaining popularity, i.e., heap corruption, out-of-bounds read, and 
use-after-free. The paper also noted that prior hardware proposals for solving the problem are unsatisfactory 
for five reasons. First, many prior works require extending registers that hold pointer values with extra metadata 
bits, hence forming what is called "fat pointers". The proposed design will, however, incur radical changes to the 
core pipeline and increase power consumption of the processor.
Secondly, most prior works also require an explicit bound checks instruction before every memory operation, which
unfortunately causes an non-negligible increase in the number of instruction executed and brings large instruction 
overhead even if the checks are themselves very fast. Similarly, when performing pointer arithmetics and assignments,
these proposals also need explicit instructions to propagate the per-pointer metadata, which further exacerbate the 
design's runtime overhead. The fourth reason is high memory overhead, which is especially true if the design 
allocates shadow memory for every possible memory location in the address space.
Lastly, prior works often introduce complicated schemes to address runtime metadata that is essential for performing 
memory checks. The addressing scheme can potentially introduce a considerable number of extra operations 
which may slow down execution.

The design of AOS overcomes the above five challenges by embedding the metadata in higher unused bits of pointers and 
then directly use the bits as an index into a set-associative lookup table in the main memory. 
AOS is based on an existing feature provided by ARM ISA, namely, the Pointer Authentication (PA) instructions. 
In the current PA design, a pointer value is embedded with a Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) computed from the 
pointer value itself plus a context value (which is usually the stack pointer).
