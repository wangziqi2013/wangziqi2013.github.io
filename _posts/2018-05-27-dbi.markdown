Several cache system optimizations rely on the dirty bit storage being fast and having 
low latency. This, however, is usually not the case in today's design, where the dirty
bit is part of the tag array. In order to access the array, an index needs to be generated
and is used to activate all tags in the set. This paper proposes an alternative storage format
of dirty bits in a cache. Instead of encoding the dirty bit either with the cache coherence 
state (e.g. "M" state in MESI protocol) or as a separate bit for each element in the set, this 
paper recommends encoding dirty bits for a DRAM row
