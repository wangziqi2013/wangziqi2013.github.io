Several cache system optimizations rely on the dirty bit storage being fast and having 
low latency. This, however, is usually not the case in today's design, where the dirty
bit is part of the tag array. In order to access the array, an index needs to be generated
and is used to activate all tags in the set. This paper proposes an alternative storage format
of dirty bits in a cache. Instead of encoding the dirty bit either with the cache coherence 
state (e.g. "M" state in MESI protocol) or as a separate bit for each element in the set, this 
paper recommends a scheme, called the *Dirty-Block Index* (DBI), which decouples the storage of cache 
sets and dirty bits. The DBI scheme stores dirty bits as an array of tagged entries. Each entry
stores a bit array for a DRAM row. Each bit in the entry represents the dirty status of a cache block
in the row. The tag of the entry encodes the identity of the DRAM row. The entire DBI storage is 
organized as a fully associative cache. The dirty status of a cache line can be located using the 
row address and the cache block offset in a row.
