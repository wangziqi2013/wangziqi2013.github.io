This paper proposes a cache insertion policy that increases actual block reuse by delaying the insertion of the data
block. The paper is motivated by the fact that, at LLC level, block re-usage is not as common as one may expect at 
higher levels of the hierarchy, mainly because locality has already been filtered out by higher level caches.
