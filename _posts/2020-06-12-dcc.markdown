This paper proposes Decoupled Compressed Cache (DCC), a tag mapping framework for compressed LLC featuring low area cost
and high space utilization. The paper points out that previous tag mapping schemes have three major flaws. The first is 
internal fragmentation, which happens when compressed blocks could only be aligned to a certain segment boundary, as in 
segmented cache designs. Blocks could not take advantage of every byte of the physical segment allocated to it, wasting 
the rest storage of the segment.
