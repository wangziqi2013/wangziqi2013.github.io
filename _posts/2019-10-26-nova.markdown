This paper presents NOVA, a file system optimized for NVM which provides strong atomicity guarantees. In order for a 
file system operation to be atomic, either all of its sub-operations are committed to persistent storage, or none of them is
committed. This is especially true when the file system suffers from a crash or failure, in which case the persistent
storage may only contain partially updates states, due to the fact that page buffers maintained by the OS or hardware 
caches can evict pages back to the storage at unpredicable times.
