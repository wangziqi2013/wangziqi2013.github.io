This paper presents pLock, a distributed locking scheme for high performance computing (HPC) implemented on SW26010 architecture.
Typical HPC architectures use Explicit Message Passing (EMP) to implement inter-core communication. Shared data between
cores must be explicitly sent and received by primitives rather than implicitly acquired via cache coherence protocol.
In fact, most HPC does not implememt cache coherence and shared address space for efficiency reasons. As a result, these
HPC platforms support the abstraction of critical sections using one or more dedicated lock servers. Before entering the
critical section, a core must send a request to the lock server, which is then granted if the lock is currently unheld,
or queued into the requestor list by the lock server if otherwise. When a thread finishes the critical section, it
sends an unlock message to the lock server, which causes the latter to either release the lock, or grant the lock
to the next requestor in the requestor list. For N cores and S critical sections on each core, this will incur 3NS
messages (1 for request, 1 for grant, and 1 for release).

This paper observes that
