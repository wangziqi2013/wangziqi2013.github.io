This paper presents pLock, a distributed locking scheme for high performance computing (HPC) implemented on SW26010 architecture.
Typical HPC architectures use Explicit Message Passing (EMP) to implement inter-core communication. Shared data between
cores must be explicitly sent and received by primitives rather than implicitly acquired via cache coherence protocol.
In fact, most HPC does not implememt cache coherence and shared address space for efficiency reasons. As a result, these
HPC platforms support the abstraction of critical sections using one or more dedicated lock servers. 
This paper observes 
that with an entirely different inter-core communication mechanism, shared memory synchronization can be rather inefficient
