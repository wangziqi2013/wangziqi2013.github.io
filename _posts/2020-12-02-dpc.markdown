This paper proposes Dual-Phase Compression (DPC), a novel NVM-based memory architecture featuring memory compression
with lower access latency and better NVM lifetime.
The paper points out that previous proposals using memory compression face a few issues. 
First, these proposals usually radically modify existing cache hierarchy and memory hierarchy with specialized hardware,
which brings compatibility and hardware cost challenges. 
Second, memory compression increases access latency, sometimes even significantly, to the main memory, which can become
problematic when the compression algorithm is a general-purpose one. 
Third, most previous proposals only optimize for either bandwidth or endurance of NVM device, but not both.
