This paper extends the idea of Tagless DRAM Cache, and aims at solving the over-fetching
problem when main memory is cached in page granularity. The over-fetching problem states that
if the locality of memory accesses on a page is low, the bandwidth requirement and latency for 
bringing the entire page into L4 cache as
