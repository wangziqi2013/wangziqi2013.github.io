**Highlight:**

1. Metadata mapping can be performed by direct mapping into a reserved address space of physical DRAM. The overall overhead
   is as low as 1/16 of the address space (assuming 64B to 4KB mapping).

**Lowlight:**

1. Although the paper delivers its ideas , it can be more structured and organized. For example, there is no mentioning
   of the metadata cache until Sec. IV.B.2, and neither after.
   Rather than proposing and describing a research prototype, this paper is closer to evluating different ideas of 
   main memory compression, realizing the trade-offs, making the correct design decisions, and finally assembling
   all aspects together into a working memory compression scheme.

This paper proposes Compresso, a main memory framework featuring low data movement cost, low metadata cost and ease of 
deployment. The paper begins
