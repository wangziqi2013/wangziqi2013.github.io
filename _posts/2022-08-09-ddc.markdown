This paper proposes Dual Dictionary Compression (DDC), a compressed cache and main memory architecture that
leverages two separate dictionaries for compressing the cache and memory data, respectively.
The paper is motivated by the memory bandwidth saving benefit of transferring compressed blocks on the bus,
which most previous proposals on cache compression do not focus on.
