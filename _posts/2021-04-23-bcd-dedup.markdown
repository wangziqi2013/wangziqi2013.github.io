This paper presents BCD deduplication, a memory compression technique using block clustering inter-block compression.
The paper points out the limitations of previous deduplication and compression proposals as follows.
First, many previous schemes rely on in-memory mapping table for address remapping, due to blocks being 
variable sized after compression. These mapping tables inevitably incur more memory accesses during both reads
and writes, which will affect performance.
