This paper proposes Software-Defined Mapping (SDM), a software-hardware co-design aimed at optimizing address mapping
for 3D stacked memory.
The paper is motivated by the channel contention problem in high-performance 3D memory introduced by the static 
physical-to-hardware address mapping scheme. 
The paper proposes a virtualized, dynamic address remapping scheme that performs address mapping in the unit of
chunks.
