This paper proposes HOOP, a hardware redo logging design with low write amplification and performance overhead for
achieving transactional failure atomicity.
The paper is motivated by the fact that most previous designs either use logging or shadow paging, which both have 
flaws. Logging, for example, requiring writing the same piece of data twice, first to the log buffer, and then to
the home location, which doubles the write bandwidth to the NVM device, harming device lifetime as well as available
bandwidth on the bus. In addition, both undo and redo logging approaches enforce write ordering between log entry
and dirty data, which is on the critical path of the execution, degrading performance as the pipeline gets frequently stalled.
Shadow paging, on the other hand, still incurs write amplification if implemented in page granularity. With cache
line granularity shadowing, writes no longer require duplicating a page, but previous hardware proposals introduce
other performance bottleneck such as TLB translation entries which brings TLB shootdown cost on each entry update. 
Furthermore, the paper points out that log-structured NVM is also infisible, despite good write performance and 
locality, due to the high read indirection cost, which can be as bad as O(log(N)) where N is the number of log 
entries on the device.
