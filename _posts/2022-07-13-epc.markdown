This paper proposes Entropy-Based Pattern Compression (EPC), a novel main memory compression and decompression
pipeline that utilizes global common patterns for higher compression ratio than single-block compression.
The proposed design compresses memory blocks to be stored in the DRAM using a pattern table, which is trained
from the data stream being written into DRAM earlier. This leverages global pattern information, and enables 
compression to work using inter-block redundancy.
The pattern table stores common bit patterns that are found in the data blocks, and compression works by replacing
the same pattern in the incoming block with indices to the pattern table entries.
Furthermore, the paper proposes three optimizations in the compression pipeline for transforming data words,
hence increasing the chances that incoming data blocks can be compressed using the pattern table.
