This paper proposes Entropy-Based Pattern Compression (EPC), a novel main memory compression and decompression
pipeline that utilizes global common patterns for higher compression ratio than single-block compression.
The proposed design compresses memory blocks to be stored in the DRAM using a pattern table, which is trained
from the data stream being written into DRAM earlier. This leverages global pattern information, and enables 
compression to work using inter-block redundancy.
The pattern table stores common bit patterns that are found in the data blocks, and compression works by replacing
the same pattern in the incoming block with indices to the pattern table entries.
Furthermore, the paper proposes three optimizations in the compression pipeline for transforming data words,
hence increasing the chances that incoming data blocks can be compressed using the pattern table.

The EPC design uses the Attache architecture to store compressed blocks in DRAM internal rows and to track metadata.
To elaborate: The attache design divides a DRAM row into two sub-rows (sub-ranks) that can be activated 
separately. If two consecutive rows are compressed to less than or equal to 30 bytes, then the two rows are able 
to be stored within only one single row, and can be accessed separately by activating different ranks, hence doubling 
the bandwidth if both lines are accessed.
Rows that cannot be compressed to <= 30 bytes remain uncompressed, and are stored in the 
first rank of the original row.
Each compressed row also has a 2-byte magic marker prefixing the actual compressed content. The magic marker 
is used by the DRAM controller to distinguish between a compressed row stored in a sub-rank, and an uncompressed row.
