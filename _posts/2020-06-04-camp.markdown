This paper proposes Compression Aware Management Policies (CAMP), which is a set of cache management policy specifically
tuned for compressed caches. Cache compression has been proposed by prior publications to reduce memory traffic as well
as to increase effective cache size. Its effectiveness, however, also depends on the cache management policy. Conventional
policies such as LRU, or, commercially adopted policies such as RRIP, may not be optimal for compressed caches. To solve
this issue, more factors need to be taken into consideration when designing management policies for compressed caches.

The paper makes two critical observations. First, due to the fact that compressed blocks are of different sizes, sometimes
significantly different, Belady's OPT cache replacement algorithm may no longer be optimal in terms of number of misses, 
if multiple cache blocks need to be evicted as replacement for a larger block. In this case, cache replacement policies 
that implicitly or explicitly relies on future reuse distances may no longer provide good performance numbers.
