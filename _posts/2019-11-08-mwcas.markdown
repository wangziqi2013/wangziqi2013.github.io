This paper presents an algorithm for implementing Multi-Word Compare-and-Swap (MWCAS). MWCAS is useful as a basic primitive 
in constructing lock-free algorithms, as an enhancement to the already-present single word CAS on most platforms. Compared
with previous proposals, this paper's MWCAS implementation has the following features that make it attractive to data
structure designers. First,
