This paper proposes SIPT, a cache design that uses speculative bits obtained from virtual addresses for set 
selection, without incurring synonym and homonym problems as in virtually indexed caches. 
In a traditional virtually indexed, physically tagged L1 cache, the cache lookup uses the bits that do not 
change during the translation as the set index. The translation and set selection can thus be parallized, and TLB 
lookup is likely not on the critical path of the memory operation. The downside of this approach is that the L1 way 
size is limited. Assuming 4KB page size and 64 byte cache line size, at most 6 bits can be used as the set 
index. The maximum number of sets is therefore only 64, and the maximum size of each way is 4KB. If we want to build 
a larger L1 cache, the only viable way is to increase the number of ways in a set, which also increases the latency
and energy consumption because more tags and data needs to be read and compared. Nowadays, typical L1d cache is eight 
way set-associative, and the size is 32KB.

Instead of keep on adding ways in a set, the cache can use more bits to select sets.
