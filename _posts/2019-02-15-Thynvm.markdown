This paper proposes ThyNVM, a hardware checkpointing mechanism that uses multi-granularity multiversioning. Before ThyNVM,
there are two ways of achieving continuous checkpointing: Logging and shadow page. Both approaches have inherent problems
that limit their efficiency. For logging, the granularity that data are copied into the log plays an important role in the 
performance of the system. If log entries are generated on a fine granularity, then metadata overhead will be a few times
larger than logged data itself, since for each log entry, we need to store the transaction ID, log LSN
