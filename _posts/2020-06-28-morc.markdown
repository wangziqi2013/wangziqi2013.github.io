This paper proposes MORC, a novel log-structured last-level cache (LLC) design optimized for high throughput but longer
access latency. The paper identifies that on modern multicore architectures, the performance of a single core is less
important than the overall system throughput. As in previous works, MORC takes advantage of cache compression to increase
overall system throughput by providing a larger effective cache, allowing more accesses to be fulfilled by the LLC,
rather than the more power-hungey and lower latency DRAM.
