This paper presents Consistent and Durable Data Structures (CDDS), a software technique for ensuring the consistency
of data structures on Non-Volatile memory (NVM). As NVM devices are directly attached to the memory bus, it is 
difficult to reason about persistence state changes due to the fact that memory writes can be made persistent on the device 
in arbitrary order. Even in the case where certain memory orderings are enforced, performing a data structure operation
often requires several writes on non-continuous locations, making it non-trivial to guarantee atomicity, the lack of 
which can introduce inconsistency to the data structure. 

This paper proposes two levels of abstraction of implementing a CDDS. The first level implements an interface which flushes
a series of cache lines back to the NVM, acting as a persistence barrier. All instructions executed after the persistence
barrier can safely assume that previous writes have made to the NVM. The interface, named flush(), however, only supports
8 byte atomic write to persistent storage. In other words, if system crashes at the moment flush() is being executed 
by the processor, some cache blocks may not reach the NVM before the crash, the content of which will be lost.
