This paper proposes Jenga, a software-defined, configurable cache hierarchy. The paper points out that the conventional, 
rigid cache hierarchy has two disadvantages. First, as the size of the working set is becoming larger, cache hierarchy
can actually hinder performance, if most of the accesses will miss in the LLC. In this case, the request must perform a 
lookup at LLC, which turns out to be a miss, and then access the main memory. The cycles spent on accessing the LLC, in
the common case of a miss, are wasted, and could be avoided if the request bypasses the LLC. Second, excessive hierarchies
consume energy without providing proportional benefits. Even if the latency of accessing these cache levels can be hidden
or overlapped using vsrious techniques, the energy consumption cannot be hidden, and is only becoming worse as the size
of the cache increases.
