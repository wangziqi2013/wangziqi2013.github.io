This paper presents In-Cache Line Logging (InCLL), a novel technique for accelerating undo logging in certain non-volatile
data structures. InCLL is motivated by the fact that traditional undo-based logging has an important implication: the 
undo log entry must reach the persistent NVM before dirty data does, because otherwise, when the system crashes, all in-cache
data will be lost, and there would be no way to recover the system state to the before state using undo image. With today's
commercial hardware, the write ordering between the log entry and dirty data (which can reside in different cache lines) 
must be enforced using cache flush and memory fence instructions, which can be inefficient if log flushes are frequent.
