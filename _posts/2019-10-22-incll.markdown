**Highlights:**

1. Taking advantage of the fact that a pointer in x86-64 only has 48 effective bits.

2. The InCLL logging scheme works equally well for sequential insert/delete and random update, leveraging 
   the fact that inserts/deletes (but not the mixture) can be undone rather efficiently just by restoring the permutation 
   field.

**Lowlights::**

1. wbinvd is a previleged instruction. On epoch boundaries a system call must be performed to flush the entire cache.

2. When the high bits of the current epoch cannot be represented by nodeEpoch during value logging, we can simply
   perform a "no-op" permutation field logging first, which updates the nodeEpoch with current epoch, and then
   the value log entry can use the higher bits of nodeEpoch.

This paper presents In-Cache Line Logging (InCLL), a novel technique for accelerating undo logging in certain non-volatile
data structures. InCLL is motivated by the fact that traditional undo-based logging has an important implication: the 
undo log entry must reach the persistent NVM before dirty data does, because otherwise, when the system crashes, all in-cache
data will be lost, and there would be no way to recover the system state to the before state using undo image. With today's
commercial hardware, the write ordering between the log entry and dirty data (which can reside in different cache lines) 
must be enforced using cache flush and memory fence instructions, which can be inefficient if log flushes are frequent.

Instead of precise undo logging, InCLL adopts an epoch-based checkpointing model, in which the data structure is checkpointed
for every 50ms. The interval between two consecutive checkpoints is called an "epoch", during which the data stucture works
normally as the volatile version. On the epoch boundary, all worker threads are blocked until the checkpointing is completed, 
leaving the data structure in a consistent state (i.e. no operation is currently going on). A seperate checkpointing thread 
then flushes the system cache (using "wbinvd" instruction), after which all dirty cache lines are persistent in the NVM, 
making the NVM image also a consistent state. After a system crash, it is guaranteed that the state of the data structure 
can be restored to the consistent state in the previously completed checkpoint by applying the undo log entries to 
objects that are modified in the failed epoch. 

This paper uses Masstree as the platform to demonstrate how InCLL works with common data structures. Masstree is a combination
of B+Tree and Radix tree. Instead of having "flat" nodes as in a regular radix tree, a B+Tree is used to support extremely
large fanouts at each radix tree level. In masstree, each radix tree level has 2^64 fanouts, mapping a key of 64 bits to 
one of the next level B+Tree. The B+Tree, therefore, has fixed key length (8 byte binary data) and value length (8 byte 
pointers). To further reduce data movement when inserting or deleting elements, a permutation field is added into each node 
of the B+Tree, such that the elements need not be sorted. The permutation field is a 64 bit word mapping elements from their
sorted location to physical location within the node, which can be modified atomically with regular store instructions
if properly aligned. Each node of the Masstree consists 15 key-value pairs, plus the permutation field. 

InCLL extends the non-volatile Masstree to support efficient crash consistency based on the following observations. First, 
if the undo log and the dirty data resides in the same cache, no write ordering needs to be enforced, since existing
hardware all guaratee that a cache line is persisted atomically, i.e. either the entire cache line is persisted, or
none of it is persisted. Placing the undo log entry in the same cache line as dirty data therefore can reduce the 
cache flush and memory fence overhead, since either the dirty data is written back to the NVM during exeution, and so does
the undo log entry, or both of them are wiped out by the crash, doing no harm at all to the NVM image. The second observation
is that only the permutation field needs to be logged when inserting or deleting of elements from a node, since a physical
slot can be invalidated simplying by writing a special value into the permutation field. Initially, all fields in the 
permutation field indicates invalid mapping. When a new element is added, the key and value is appended to the physical
array, and the permutation field is modified to map the key's logical slot to its physical location in the node. In order
to undo this insert, simply restoring the permutation field to its before state is sufficient, as the newly inserted key
and value will be demapped once the original permutation is restored. The same reasoning also applies to deletion of keys.
The last observation is that, for random update workloads, the chance that a node is updated more than once is rather low.
InCLL can therefore optimize for one update per epoch with in-cache line logging, and fall back to external, object based 
undo logging if this does not hold.

InCLL changes the node layout of Masstree as follows. In the volatile version of the Masstree, a node consists of a permutation
field, a metadata field, an array of 15 keys, and an array of 15 values, fitting into four 64 byte cache lines. InCLL changes
the node layout by adding extra logging related field as follows. First, all nodes must be allocated to 64 byte aligned 
addresses. Second, an undo image of the permutation field and several control bits are added to the first cache line which 
also stores the permutation field. A "nodeEpoch" field is also added to record the most recent epoch in which the content 
of the permutation field is logged. Second, a Masstree node now only stores 14 key-value pairs. The 14 8 byte keys are 
stored in the next two cache lines following the permutation field and logging fields. Then, in the fourth cache line, we 
store an 8 byte log entry for key 0 to key 6, and in the fifth cache line, we store key 7 to key 13, and then another 8
byte log entry for the last seven keys. In this modified node layout, both the permutation log and the two value log entries
are stored in the same cache line as the dirty data, leveraging the first observation in the previous paragraph. 

When an element is inserted, assuming no node split happens, the permutation field is first logged, and then the new key 
and value is written into the physical slot. The nodeEpoch field is also updated to indicate that a log entry has been
written for the permutation field. The actual permutation is only updated after all of the above are written. Note that
although a cache flush and memory fence is not needed here, this write ordering between the log entry and the in-place
update is still critical to the correctness of the algorithm. In addition, the nodeEpoch must only be updated after the 
log entry is written, because otherwise if the system crashes between these two writes, the nodeEpoch will indicate a
log entry is available, while the entry is in fact not written yet, causing recovery failure. The next time an element
is inserted, we first check whether nodeEpoch equals the current system epoch. If this is the case, no extra logging 
is needed, since it is sufficient to just log the permutation once.

Element deletion is logged in a similar manner. The only corner case that requires special handling is when an element 
is first deleted, and then a new element is inserted into the same physical slot. In this case, simply restoring the 
permutation field after a crash is not right, since the content of the key-value array has also been changed, while such
change is not rolled back (the deleted pair will be lost, since its slot is recycled and allocated to a new pair). If this
happens, the paper suggests that the node be externally logged to avoid data corruption. Two extra control bits, isLogged
and insAllowed, controls whether the node has been externally logged (and hence no further logging is needed for the entire
node), and whether element deletion has happened such that all future inserts should trigger external logging.

Logging node updates requires more delicate handling of the log entry, as we will see below. As the log entry only
has 8 bytes, it would be difficult to squeeze both the before image of the modified value, the index of the value, and the
epoch in which the log is written without taking advantage of the special property of the value stored in Masstree. Fortunately,
it is noted that Masstree values are always pointers. On x86-64 platform, a virtual address pointer only has 48 effective
bits. Bit 48 to bit 63 are not used, which just duplicate bit 47. Furthermore, since most allocators nowadays will align 
memory blocks to 16 byte boundary, the lowest four bits are always zero. The logging process is described as follows.
First, the before value is copied into the log entry, with bit 0 to 3, bit 48 to 63 masked out. Then, the index of the 
element and the 16 bit epoch is written into bit 0 to 3 and bit 48 to 63 of the log entry field respectively. The
same write ordering applies as in element insertion. The true update is only performed after the updates to the log entry 
is completed. Note that in this scheme, the epoch number is only the low 16 bits of the current epoch in which the 
value log is generated. We assume that the higher bits of the current epoch can be represented by the higher bits of the 
nodeEpoch. If this is not true, or the log entry in the same cache line as the value to be updated has already been used, 
external logging is used, if not already.

Each node is only externally logged once during the same epoch, even if the object can be updated multiple times. This is 
achieved by adding another external log epoch number into the node. Before a node is to be externally logged, we check
whether this epoch number equals the current epoch. If true, the logging is skipped, since the before image of the 
node already exists. Only logging each node once during an epoch helps recovery also, since the restoration can be done in
parallel. Otherwise, if there are multiple undo images for the same node, these undo images must be applied in
the reverse order they are created. The paper also suggest that only leaf node updates be logged with InCLL. All other 
modifications, such as node split/merge or internal node updates, are externally logged, since these modifications
are relatively infrequent. 

During recovery, the external log is first copies back to their original locations in parallel by a few recovery threads.
