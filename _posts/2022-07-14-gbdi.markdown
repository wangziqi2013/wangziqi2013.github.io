**Comments:**

1. The paper did not evaluate recompression. Instead, it only shows that for a single workload, compressibility
does not change much. The problem is that recompression is inevitable, if the workload consists of many
different applications on a multicore system.

In addition, context switch may be problematic, because the global bases are not part of any context. 
As a result, the more applications there are in the system, the more likely the number of global bases will be larger.
The paper did not evaluate mixtures of different workloads. Instead, only the same workload is simulated.
