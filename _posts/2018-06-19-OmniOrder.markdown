Conflict-based Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) suffers from high abort rates when conflicts are frequent.
This is caused by the simple conflict detection mechanism which treats any cache coherence message that hits 
transactional cache lines as potential sources of violation. The only exception to this rule is bus read shared 
request on shared or exclusive lines, as reader processor cannot conflict with other readers. Processors 
will abort and restart if a conflict is detected, discarding any speculative states from its private cache, 
because there is zero information for tracking how the cache line will be used by another processor. This 
property is sub-optimal, because not all dependencies imply violations at the end of the execution.

This paper proposes OmniOrder, an HTM extension on existing commercial HTM such as Intel TSX to support more 
efficient dependency reasoning. Instead of keeping zero information about global usage of a cache line, processors 
are extended with a few structures that can track the modification history as well as dependencies of 
speculatively modified cache lines. One of the highlights in the design of OmniOrder is its native support for 
unmodified directory-based cache coherence protocol. This feature is crucial for a practical HTM design, for two
reasons. First, directory based protocol is a must in today's high performance architecture. Inability to 
support directory based protocol is a huge deficiency. In contrast, some HTM designs require broadcast 
cache coherence protocol, which makes the design non-scalable and impossible to port to large scale systems.
Second, unmodified coherence protocol implies only incremental change is needed on existing microarchitecture.
Designing and verifying a correct coherence protocol is difficult. What makes it worse is that the actual 
number of state in the state machine is far more than the steady states. Transient states that handle
race conditions must be added to ensure multiple operations can be performed in parallel. All these factors 
discourage the invention of a new coherence protocol. In the next paragraph we cover in detail the hardware 
changes required to implement OmniOrder.

In OmniOrder, each processor is extended with two buffers: One L0 cache to hold speculative values it 
has written on the cache line, and a Speculative Version Buffer (SVB) that holds the global modification
history of cache lines currently in its private cache. Both can be organized in a similar way as caches, 
using a few bits from the address to select cache set, and then use tag comparison to locate the way.
Four bit vectors are also added to each processor. The first two bit vectors are successor vector and predecessor 
vector. They record read/write dependencies into which the current processor participates, as sources and 
destinations, respectively. The third bit vector is called the squash vector, which records the Read-after-Write
dependency in which the processor is the destination. The name of the vector suggests its function: When the 
processor reads uncommitted data from another one, and the latter aborts, the current processor must also
abort to maintain isolation property. The width of the first three vectors is the number of processors 
in the system. The last vector is the directory successor vector. Its width is the number of directories.
A bit is set if speculative data generated by this processor is maintained and tracked by the directory. 
We cover more details about directories acting as "proxies" for processors that have shared their uncommitted
data. L0 and SVB must not be written back to memory, and not visible to non-transactional instructions. 
If an overflow is inevitable, the current transaction must abort. This implies that OmniOrder is not 
unbounded.
