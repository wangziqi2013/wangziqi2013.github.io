**Highlight:**

1. Performing logical logging using EXT4 DAX's underlying atomic operation as primitives is a great innovation.

2. I like the idea of only writing data once while still providing data atomicity. Journaling file systems cannot
   do this because the journal is a shared object used for many purposes, such as metadata logging. This paper proposes 
   decoupling data logging from other journaling tasks, and doing per-file journaling (i.e. having multiple staging files 
   for handling writes). This has the advantage of both in-place update (optimized for read) and per-object journaling
   (optimized for write, less I/O).

**Lowlights:**
1. Despite promising results, I do not quite buy the paper's argument that Split file system can reduce
software overhead. I understand that using block swap instead of write-ahead logging can save you some I/O (writing
only once vs writing twice), but I cannot see how this reduce software overhead, or the paper uses the term "software
overhead" to refer to logging?

2. Another confusing argument in this paper is that while logical logging is used to enforce atomicity of multi-step operation
(which is an innovation), the paper did not mention that in order for this to work, we should issue fsync() to the 
underlying EXT4, and rely on atomicity guarantees of EXT4 and persistence guarantee of fsync() to log abstract
operations of EXT4.

This paper presents SplitFS, a user-space file system implementation aiming at reducing software overhead when running on
the NVM. Byte-addressable NVM is more sensitive to the overhead of software stack due to its lower latency and higher bandwidth
compared with conventional disks and SSD. The paper observes that most kernel file systems introduce non-negligible software
overhead by performing file system calls into the kernal on normal operations such as file open and read/write. For example,
the paper points out that on write operations, the file system has to perform block allocation, logging, metadata update, 
etc., which are all on the critical path. 

SplitFS features a hybrid architecture in which metadata operations are delegatd to existing kernel file systems such
as EXT4 DAX, while user data manipulation and semantics guarantees are delivered by a user space module. Building on top
of an existing file system has two obvious benefits. First, metadata operations are rarer compared with data operations,
while they often have subtle outcomes and implications, which on a software engineering point of view, is difficult to
get correct without many hours of testing. Rather than dedicating thousands of hours creating and debugging a brand new 
mechanism that will not be used as frequently as normal data operations, just relying on existing mechanisms will be 
a good balancing point reagrding both performance and ease of development. Second, EXT4 only delivers limited semantics
guarantees (i.e. POSIX), while in practice, a stricter or looser semantics may be desired. For example, the paper mentioned
that SQLite does not require data writes to be fully atomic with regard to failures, since data writes are protected by
logs, and log entry writes are ordered in a way that partially written log records can be identified. In such a use case,
if the file system provides atomic write guarantees, we will have a write amplification problem, because every data and 
log write will be first logged by the file system, which is unnecessary. On the other hand, if the file system provides
a strong support for atomicity and persistency of data, no logging is required even for transactional systems, as the 
logging can be done by the file system. SplitFS is able to provide different semantics guarantees by implementing flexible 
logging scheme in user space, which makes it more versatile. EXT4 DAX simply provides metadata atomicity guarantee, which
enables logical logging to be used. 

SplitFS provides three operating modes: POSIX, sync, and strict. Under POSIX mode, only metadata operations are guaranteed
to be atomic with regard to failures. They are not necessarily synchronized (i.e. metadata updates may not be persisted
and are prone to be lost even after the corresponding file system call returns). Data operations are neither atomic
nor syncrhronized. Under sync mode, metadata operations are atomic and synchronized, and data operations are only synchronized
but non-atomic. Note that atomicity does not imply synchronicity, since even if a write operation is atomic, the content
of the write can still be lost after a crash if it is not synchronous. Synchronicity also does not imply atomicity,
since synchronicity of write operations only dictate that the content of the write will not be lost after the operation
completes; Partial writes can still occur if the system crashed before the write can return. Under strict mode, all metadata
and data operations are atomic and synchronized, which means that their effect will be persistent right after the 
call returns, and if a crash happens before the operation completes, no harm will be done, and all partial updates
will be rolled back. In the following discussion, we focus on the strict mode to demonstrate how SplitFS levarages 
EXT4 DAX.

SplitFS is compiled as a user space library, and is loaded at binary load time using LD\_PRELOAD directive provided 
by the shell. The library overrides certain POSIX file system calls at glibc level (which is dynamically linked 
into the executable). When a glibc file system call is made by the application, SplitFS intercepts that call, analyzes
the type and argument, and either redirect that call to the underlying EXT4 DAX file system (with possibly altered
arguments and/or issuing more calls), or simply handles the request by itself. Since each application program has 
an instance of SplitFS running with it, SplitFS can provide support for different file access semantics to different
applications in the same operating system. 

At a high level, SplitFS handles writes atomically and synchronously using two techniques. The first technique is based
on the observation that EXT4 DAX metadata operations are atomic (but no more!), which is demanded by POSIX. With these
atomic "abstract operations" at hand, SplitFS only performs logical redo logging, which logs the high level abstarct
operation on EXT4, and delegates the enforcement of atomicity of these abstract operations to EXT4. As a result, log
entries in SplitFS are usually quite short, no larger than a single cache line for most simple operations, since only
abstract EXT4 operations and their arguments are logged. The second technique is the use of staging files to buffer 
updates before they finally commit. Under strict mode, we must guarantee that an operation is recoverable if its operation
has returned to the caller, and otherwise all changes may be simply discarded (but it does no harm to commit them
whenever commit is possible). On each write or append request, SplitFS will redirect these writes to a pre-allocated
staging file on the underlying EXT4 DAX file system, and create log entries describing the write. When the write is 
to be committed, SplitFS issues a special command, EXT4\_IOC\_MOVE\_EXT, to EXT4 DAX using ioctl interface, the 
purpose of which is to atomically transfer the blocks in the staging file (i.e. dirty data of the write) to the actual
being modified. The atomicity of this operation again is guaranteed by EXT4 DAX. During this process, only one write I/O
to the NVM is performed instead of two, which is common for file systems that juornals data to provide atomic writes
(first write to the journal, and second write to the actual file in-place). 

On write or append operations, SplitFS first redirect data of the write or append to one of the free staging file. To
avoid allocating staging files from EXT4 DAX on-demand, which is on the critical path and involves relatively slower
metadata operations, SplitFS maintains a pool of free staging files, and pre-allocates a few from EXT4 DAX when it
starts up. SplitFS also writes logs to reflect EXT4 DAX operations, such that they can be redone. When the write 
operation is to be committed, SplitFS writes a commit record to the log, and then issues a MOVE\_EXT call to EXT4 DAX, 
which atomically swaps dirty blocks in the staging file to the master file, as described earlier. If synchronizicy is 
desired, SplitFS also issues fsync() on both files before the call returns. If the system crashes before writes are 
committed, no harm will be done to the master file, since it has not been updated in-place. The staging file will be
deleted during recovery after they are identified (on clean shutdown there should not be any non-empty staging file,
so just scan the pool and remove any staging file that are not empty).
