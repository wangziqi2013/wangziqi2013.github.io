This paper presents SplitFS, a user-space file system implementation aiming at reducing software overhead when running on
the NVM. Byte-addressable NVM is more sensitive to the overhead of software stack due to its lower latency and higher bandwidth
compared with conventional disks and SSD. The paper observes that most kernel file systems introduce non-negligible software
overhead by performing file system calls into the kernal on normal operations such as file open and read/write. For example,
the paper points out that on write operations, the file system has to perform block allocation, logging, metadata update, 
etc., which are all on the critical path.
