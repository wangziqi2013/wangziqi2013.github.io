This paper proposes Lelantus, a hardware virtual memory optimization for Copy-On-Write (COW) operations.
The paper has observed that COW is a commonly used technique by the OS to delay the actual copy of physical pages
when forking a process. The page will remain in read-only mode until the first write by either of the two processes,
at which time the page is duplicated, and the write is performed on the new copy. The virtual address mapping 
for the writing process is also updated to point to the newly copied page.
