**Lowlight:**

1. The design is not even remotely related to NVM and security. Essentially it just proposes adding extra per-page
   metadata bits to track copy status for every COW'ed page.

2. There are lots of writing inconsistencies and typos in the second half of the paper. For example, on section 4
   page 7, left bottom, it is stated "three CoW commands in the memory controller: page copy, page phyc and
   page init.", while on the same page, right column, table 2, the three commands become page\_copy, page\_phyc
   and page\_free. Page\_init is in fact never discussed, which I believe should be a typo of page\_copy.
   On page 7, section 4B, it should be "stale data" not "stall data".
   On page 8, section 4C, it should be "traverse", not "transverse".
   On page 9, second line of the left column, it should be "rely on", not "relay on".

This paper proposes Lelantus, a hardware virtual memory optimization for Copy-On-Write (COW) operations.
The paper has observed that COW is a commonly used technique by the OS to delay the actual copy of physical pages
when forking a process. The page will remain in read-only mode until the first write by either of the two processes,
at which time the page is duplicated, and the write is performed on the new copy. The virtual address mapping 
for the writing process is also updated to point to the newly copied page. 
On application level, the paper also identifies several important use cases of COW feature of the OS, including 
normal fork() system calls, memory allocation where newly allocated pages are mapped to a zero page and lazily
populated on the first write, virtual machine deduplication, and application address space checkpointing.

The paper recognizes two performance related drawbacks of performing full COW on the first write. First, the first
store operation into such a page will incur much larger performance overhead than the rest of writes, causing 
performance fluctuation, which makes it harder to predict the performance of write operations. This is particularly
bad in time-sensitive applications with QoS guarantees or real-time systems where the predicatability of timing
matters even more than the latency of operations.
Second, if the page is only written sparsely, especially on systems with huge pages, the write amplification would
be high, since most of the lines copied during COW will not be written later, causing excessive but unnecessary write
bandwidth, and, even worse, shortened device lifetime if on NVM.

The paper proposes adding per-page and per-cache line metadata to help allieviating the overhead of COW. Fine-grained
metadata is added to track two pieces of information for a destination COW page: (1) Whether each cache line in the 
page has been copied, i.e., whether they still refer to the source page's read-only data; (2) The address of the 
source page. Note that under Lelantus's model, the source and destination pages are no longer of equal status.
Instead, after the logical duplication, one page is delegated as the source page, which is responsible for providing 
read-only data to readers of both pages. The other page is the destination page, which has "holes" punched on it.
Read operations to these holes will be forwarded to the associated source page, while write operations will invoke
cache line granularity COW.

We next describe the metadata format as follows. Lelantus requires one bit per cache line to track the copy status of
the line, which takes 64 bits (8 bytes) per 4KB page. In addition, it also needs one page level pointer to track the 
source page, the size of which depends on address space size and actual memory size. In total, these two extra metadata
fields take no more than 0.4% of total storage, which is negligible.
The paper specifically points out that similar metadata overhead already exists for secure NVM systems, where per-cache
line and per-page metadata are maintained. For example, under counter-mode encryption, each page has a 64-bit major 
counter and each cache line has a 7-bit minor counter. For a 4KB page, this configuration allows all metadata for the
page to be packed in a 64 byte block, which can be efficiently accessed with only one bus transaction.
We do not cover counter-mode encryption here, since the operation of counter-mode encryption is unrelated to Lelantus.
The paper suggests that Lelantus can borrow one bit from the 7-bit per-cache line counter to form the 64-bit source
page address, resulting in zero metadata overhead, at the cost of higher overflow rate of minor counters (which may,
as a consequence, incur more frequent re-encryption of page data). 
In addition, minor counter value zero is reserved in Lelantus to indicate that the cache line is not currently present
in the page, i.e., there is a "hole", the access of which should fall through to the source page. 
The counter-mode encryption controller is also modified such that on initialization and when an overflow occurs, all
minor counters should be set to one, instead of zero.

Lelantus is built into the memory controller as an accelerator of COW-related page copy. Three commands are provided
to the user, which can be invoked by writing the command code and arguments to memory-mapped controller registers.
The first command is page\_copy, which performs logical COW by providing both the source and destination page numbers
as physical addresses. The memory controller, on receiving this request, will initialize the metadata fields of the
destination page by setting all minor counters to zero, and setting the source page address to the one in the 
parameter. The second command is page\_phyc, which performs physical copy of lines that are not yet in the destination
page from the source page. This command is invoked when the source page is to be freed, in which case all "holes"
in the destination page must be filled by physical data transfer from the source to destination. After this command,
the destination page is entirely by its own, the content of which no longer depends on another page. The command
is executed by first scanning the per-line metadata bits, copying those that are not yet present, setting the counter
value to one, and then clearing the source address pointer.
