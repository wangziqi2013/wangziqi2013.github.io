This paper presents HTMFS, a file system that leverages existing Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) support to
provide strong consistency guarantees while incurring low overhead. HTMFS achieves its design goals by wrapping 
multi-store operations within hardware transactions, whose atomicity is guaranteed by the hardware. As a result,
HTMFS, compared with similar designs that use journaling or shadow paging, achieves similar or better performance 
without weakening the consistency guarantees.
