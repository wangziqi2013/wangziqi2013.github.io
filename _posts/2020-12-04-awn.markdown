This paper proposes a restrictive cache compression scheme for improving L1 cache effective capacity.
The paper points out at the beginning that conventional compression algorithms are not feasible for L1
cache compression, since they introduce a few cycle's latency during compression and decompression. Even though
the absolute number of cycles can be small, they are still significant relative to L1 cache's access latency,
which is typically only a few cycles.
