This paper proposes Gather-Scatter DRAM, a novel DRAM architecture that enables fast gather and scatter semantics.
The paper points out that current DRAM interface only supports cache line granularity access, which causes difficulties
when accessing data in a strided pattern. This prevents several common patterns from being implemented efficiently.
For example, in matrix manipulating code, accessing multiple matrix elements on the same column often requires strided 
reads, if the matrix is stored in row-major order where elements in the same row are stored.
