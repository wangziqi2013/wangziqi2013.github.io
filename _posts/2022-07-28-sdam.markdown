**Comments:**

1. Typo "verse versa" on page 5 under "Functional correctness guarantee".

2. Does the approach work on existing binaries? I think it is possible by using an instrumented malloc() library,
but the design is meant to be used in a scenario that you have the binary and can conveniently modify it, or at
least the memory allocation sites of major variables.

3. What happens after profiling? Do you identify the major variables, and manually change the source
code such that these variables are allocated to the corresponding chunks?
Can this be further automated such that the information is passed to the allocator by the profiler?

4. The results look promising, so I guess the method works well. But if you change the allocation pattern,
wouldn't you also change the access pattern? So to which extent are the profiling results representative?
I think if the major variables are big arrays, then the pattern is unlikely to change, and the problem is
just a matter of allocating big arrays from the corresponding chunk pool.

This paper proposes Software-Defined Address Mapping (SDAM), a software-hardware co-design aimed at optimizing 
address mapping for 3D stacked memory.
The paper is motivated by the channel contention problem in high-performance 3D memory introduced by the static 
physical-to-hardware address mapping scheme. 
The paper proposes a virtualized, dynamic address remapping scheme that performs address mapping in the unit of
chunks. The per-chunk address mapping is configurable, such that software components can cluster data with similar
access patterns to the same chunk.
Channel contention is reduced by performing different address mapping for different chunks based on their access 
patterns.

SDM is based on 3D stacked DRAM modules. One of the biggest difference between 3D DRAM and the regular DRAM is 
that the controller has considerably more channels (32 channels), while having much smaller rows (256 bytes).
This property opens the opportunity of Channel-Level Parallelism (CLP), where memory requests are interleaved 
on different channels, such that these requests can be serviced concurrently. 
With all channels working in parallel, 3D DRAM can deliver much higher peak bandwidth than traditional DRAM modules.

Existing 3D DRAM device uses a simple and static address mapping scheme that is initialized at boot time.
Bit slices of physical addresses are used to address channel, bank, and row.
The paper presents an example of existing physical address mapping, where the lower bits are used to address 
channel, the middle bits for bank, and high bits for row.
Such scheme, however, is vulnerable to access patterns that cause channel contention. 
For example, if the channel is addressed by the low 4 bits, then an access stride of 16 will cause all memory requests
to be handled by channel zero, serializing all memory requests, which causes under-utilization and lowers the
throughput.

Prior works leverage CLP in both hardware and software. Hardware approaches monitor the address patterns for memory
requests, and monitors the access pattern using the frequency of bit flips as a metric. 
Bits that flip the most frequently will be used to constitute the channel address, such that consecutive memory
accesses are likely to be mapped to different channels, which maximizes CLP.
Software approaches track memory access pattern at page level, and changes the physical address mapping of pages
that cause channel contention.  
The paper notes that neither approach is optimal, because the hardware approach only supports a global policy,
which is insufficient to capture all access patterns, and the software approach is only able to keep track of 
access patterns at page granularity, which might be fine for regular DRAM, but 
3D memory has row size much smaller than a page.

The paper also makes three observations regarding memory access pattern. First, when several different 
simple patterns are mixed together, the overall access pattern will be dependent on all the individual ones.
This suggests that an effective scheme must be able to adapt to changing patterns, rather than only using 
a global pattern. The second observation is that when multiple access patterns co-exist, no global address
mapping scheme works optimally. This necessitates that a per-pattern address mapping policy, because it is 
difficult to come up with a one-fit-all policy.
Lastly, the paper also observes that in SPEC, most memory accesses are only caused by a small number of 
language-level variables, and these variables constitute a large fraction of the application's memory
footprint. It is therefore sufficient to only focus on these "major variables" and capture their access pattern.

The paper proposes SDAM that works as a software-hardware co-design.
From software's perspective, data items that have similar access patterns are identified by offline profiling,
and then allocated on the same 2MB memory chunks. 
Meanwhile, the software notifies the memory controller of the access pattern of a particular chunk, and the 
memory controller stores the mapping from chunks to patterns in a special table, called the Chunk Mapping Table (CMT).
On memory accesses, chunk information is retrieved from the CMT, and the address for accessing the device is 
generated using pattern information stored in the CMT by a hardware unit, the Address Mapping Unit (AMU).
