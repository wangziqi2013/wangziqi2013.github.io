This paper proposes Bastion, a secure computing architecture built into the CPU core that allows secure execution
of trusted hypervisors, software modules, and secure storage of data on external devices. 
The paper is motivated by the fact existing mechanisms for secure computing are neither comprehensive, nor efficient,
indicating that a single mechanism is not sufficient to protect all system components without incurring high
overhead. Bastion, on the other hand, provides a set of simple hardware interfaces for integrity verification, access 
control, and encryption/decryption, and relies on a trusted (and dynamically verified) hypervisor to protect 
both dynamic execution, data access, and external I/O of applications.
