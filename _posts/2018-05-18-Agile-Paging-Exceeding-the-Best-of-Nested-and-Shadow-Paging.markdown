Hardware supported memory virtualization is crucial to the performance of a virtual environment. Two techniques
are applicable for solving memory virtualization problem. Shadow paging, which requires no extra hardware support
besides normal paging and protection machanism, stores a "shadow page table" along with the page table of the guest
OS. The hardware uses the shadow page table to perform translation. In order to maintain the consistenct between guest OS's 
view of the memory and the actual mapping implemented by the shadow page table.
