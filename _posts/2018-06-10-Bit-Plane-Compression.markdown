Compressing for main-memory can be beneficial as it saves both capacity and bus traffic. This paper mainly focuses 
on the latter, without presenting in a detailed manner how compressed blocks are stored and indexed in the DRAM array.
There exists several design trade-offs for memory compression architectures. For examples, designing for cache only
compression significantly differs from designing for main memory compression, because the former could
