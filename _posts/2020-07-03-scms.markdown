**Highlight:**

1. Letting OS decide which blocks should be compressed and hardware only follows is a illusrtration of good division of 
   responsibility (The OS initialize the page table and compressed data layout, and hardware follows this layout unless
   a fat write occurs).

2. The seamless integration between page-based memory compression and super-block based cache compression saves metadata
   overhead. Compressed blocks are not decompressed before and after transferred over the system bus, maintaining a uniform
   layout between memory and LLC.
