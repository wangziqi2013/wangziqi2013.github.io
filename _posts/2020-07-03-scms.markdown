**Highlight:**

1. Letting OS decide which blocks should be compressed and hardware only follows is a illusrtration of good division of 
   responsibility (The OS initialize the page table and compressed data layout, and hardware follows this layout unless
   a fat write occurs).

2. The seamless integration between page-based memory compression and super-block based cache compression saves metadata
   overhead. Compressed blocks are not decompressed before and after transferred over the system bus, maintaining a uniform
   layout between memory and LLC.
   
3. It is a good balancing point between efficiency and simplicity to only compress adjacent even-odd blocks.

4. Using page table to store the small compression vector for describing page layout to achieve minimum DRAM metadata overhead.

5. Using adjacent sets to store compressed blocks in the LLC to minimize LLC metadata overhead

**Lowlight:**

1. Writing is really poor. I do suggest whoever that wrote Section 1 and 2 perform a basic proof read on later sections.
   In addition, whoever wrote later sections should first make sure correct terminologies are used, and don't write like
   spagetti. 
   Overall, the paper looks like a product of pipelined writing, which is fine, but before submission can you please
   at least unify the writing style across sections.
