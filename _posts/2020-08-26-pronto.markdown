This paper presents Pronto, a software library for transforming existing data structures implemented on volatile memory
to their non-volatile counterparts. The paper points out that the current trend of implementing non-volatile data structures
either use libraries to denote failure-atomic regions, or develop ad-hoc algorithms to support persistence. Neither 
approach works very well in practice. In order to denote failure-atomic regions, the programmer needs to take an existing
data structure implementation, and instrument all memory writes with library calls. This can be tedious, errorneous, and 
most importantly, it is not always possible to instrument all memory writes, due to the usage of third-party libraries.
