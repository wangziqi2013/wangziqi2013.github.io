This paper presents Read-Log-Update (RLU), a parallel programming paradigm that replaces Read-Copy-Update (RCU)
as a lightweight synchronization primitive. RLU overcomes the limitations of RCU by providing a higher
degree of writer parallelism and better flexibility. To achieve this goal, RLU adopted the timestamp-based 
synchronization algorithm from Software Transactional Memory (STM) designs and tailored it for the specific
scenario that RLU aims to address. Compared with RCU, RLU demonstrates higher operation throughput and better
scalability on certain commonly used data structures, which proves to be a feasible alternative to RCU for 
concurrent data structure.
