# Ariel Core

## Ariel Frontend

The ariel frontend defined in `class ArielFrontend` is a generic interface for the Ariel core to obtain a tunnel object
as instruction source. The class itself is abstract and does not implement any concrete function.
Any instruction source can be implemented as a derived class of `class ArielFrontend`, and be incorporated seamlessly
into Ariel core.
