Classical lock based transactional systems usually suffer from performance bottleneck because of the extra contention
at the lock manager. Locks are essential for old systems using locking protocols such as Two-Phase Locking (2PL) to
produce serializable schedules. In the paper it is claimed that the lock manager is implemented as a centralized 
hash table. Lock entries are hashed into one of the buckets of the table. For each lock entry, lists of transactions 
that are currently holding the lock as well as those who are blocked by the lock are maintained. To protect the consistency
of the lock table data structure itself, each bucket and lock entry has a latch, which is used to serialize insert, delete
and read operations on the lock table.
