This paper proposes LATR, a software TLB coherence scheme that overcomes the overhead of traditional TLB shootdown. 
Software-based TLB shootdown has been widely adopted by Operating Systems as a way of maintaining coherence among 
private TLBs. Just like cache coherence, when a processor modifies the page table either by changing the virtual-to-physical
mapping or by altering the permissions bits in a page table entry (PTE), these modifications need to propagate to 
other processors that have cached a private copy of the PTE to avoid accessing the wrong physical page or accessing the 
page with wrong permission.
