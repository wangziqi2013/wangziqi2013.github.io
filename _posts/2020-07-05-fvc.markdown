This paper proposes Frequent Value Cache, a compressed victim cache design optimized for frequently accessed values.
This paper observes that most workloads exhibit some degrees of frequent value locality, such that a majority of accesses
and values that occur in the memory are within a narrow range of values. For example, the paper points out that the 
most frequent ten values are responsible for roughly 50% of accesses and memory locations, having great potential to be 
optmized. The paper also presents three important observations with frequent value locality. First, value locality
of accesses and value locality over the address space are surprisingly similar, not only on the values themselves, but
also on the rankings of these values. The paper further discovered that frequently values are uniformly distributed 
over the address space. No matter how accesses are localized for certain memory reagions, the frequent values accessed
by instructions are usually consistent with the values that exist in active memory.


TODO: DIFF BETWEEN FREQ VALUE LOCALITY (OVER ADDR SPACE) AND VALUE LOCALITY (ON INDIVIDUAL INST)
