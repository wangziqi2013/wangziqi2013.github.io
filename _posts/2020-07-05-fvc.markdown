This paper proposes Frequent Value Cache, a compressed victim cache design optimized for frequently accessed values.
This paper observes that most workloads exhibit some degrees of frequent value locality, such that a majority of accesses
and values that occur in the memory are within a narrow range of values. For example, the paper points out that the 
most frequent ten values are responsible for roughly 50% of accesses and memory locations.
