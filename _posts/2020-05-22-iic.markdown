This paper proposes Indirect Index Cache (IIC), a fully associative cache design featuring better hit rate and more flexible
replacement policies. The paper begins by identifying similarities between cache memory and virtual pages. Both are 
proposed and implemented as a measurement of dealing with the increasing speed gap between components in the memory hierarchy.
The difference is that on commercial produces, cache memories, at all levels, are typically implemented as a hardware-managed
array of tag and data. Tags are statically mapped to data slots. In order to access data using an address tag, tags
(or more likely, a subset of tags) need to be searched until a matching entry is found, after which the data slot is 
located at the same offset and accessed. Virtual memory, on the other hand, works differently. There is no fixed binding
between a virtual page frame and a physical page (although some implementations may enforce one to aid virtual address
caches or better performance). Any virtual page frame can hold any physical page. Hardware must consult a dedicated 
mapping structure to acquire the mapping instead.
