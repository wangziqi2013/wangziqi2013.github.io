This paper proposes Bit-Plane Compression, a data compression algorithm for better compression ratio. Conventional
compression algorithms, such as Base-Delta-Immediate (BDI), may take advantage of value locality of adjacent words
by subtracting the value from its neighbor. Since values are expected to be close to each other, these deltas are 
small, such that only a few bits is sufficient to store them, achieving the goal of compression that fewer bits are 
used to encode the same information.
