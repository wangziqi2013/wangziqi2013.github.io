This paper introduces BPFS, a file system built on top of byte-addressable NVM. The paper recognizes that NVM is a 
promising storage medium for future file storage platforms due to its byte-addressability and low latency accesses. 
Compared to a conventional file system, BPFS has several advantages. First, its low read and write latency makes BPFS 
signifantly faster than conventional file systems. Second, even compared with block-based file system ported to NVM, 
BPFS still outperforms them using a unique form of shadow paging that reduces write amplification and data copy.
Third, the byte-addressability of NVM makes small writes and certain meatdata operations fast, since only a few writes
are sufficient instead of copying and writing back entire blocks. Lastly, although not mentioned by the paper, BPFS
is capable of operating without an OS intermediate buffering level on the critical path, since the address space of the 
NVM can be directly mapped to the protected virtual addresses of the file system driver. Most notably, no data movement
between NVM and DRAM is required and hence DRAM buffer is only optional, unlike previous designs.
Besides all these, BPFS also provides a stronger semantics guarantee without incurring any overhead other than those
already exist in shadow paging.

BPFS is implemented as a block-based file system on top of NVM using shadow paging as one of the the main updating
algorithm. BPFS is compatible with the conventional file system interface, and provides a rather strong semantics
guarantee: All operations should complete (almost) atomically in the order that they are issued by the application.
