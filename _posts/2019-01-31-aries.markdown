This 69 page paper describes Algorithm for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics (ARIES) in great detail. ARIES 
is designed for providing durability to database transactions with fast recovery and low runtime overhead. ARIES also
requires less software engineering effort to adopt for an existing system, because it supports rich semantics and most
main stream database designs (as of the time the paper was published). We next describe the data structures and operations 
of ARIES.

ARIES requires two in-memory data structures to be maintained in the runtime. These two data structures are transaction
table (TT) which describes the commit state of transactions, and dirty page table (DPT). Neither of them is persisted 
to the disk except for performing checkpoints. During recovery, these two tables are recoverd by replaying log records 
since the last checkpoint.
