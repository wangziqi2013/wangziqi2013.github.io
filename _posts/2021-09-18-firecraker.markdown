This paper presents Firecracker, a lightweight VMM platform designed and optimized specifically for serverless. 
This paper contains little technical discussion, especially on the implementations of the Firecracker VMM (it is 
open-sourced, though), and it focuses more on the high-level ideas that motivate the design principals of 
Firecrackers, and how it is deployed in a production system.
