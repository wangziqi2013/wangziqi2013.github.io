This paper proposes PiCL, a novel architecture for supporting main memory checkpoints using NVM. Checkpoints are consistent 
main memory images that can be restored after power failure. In this paper, it is assumed that the execution of 
all processors in the system is divided into "epoches". Epoches are also the basic unit of recovery: At recovery time,
the main memory state is restored to the beginning of one of the previously saved epoches. The paper also assumes
that the entire system is backed by NVM connected to the memory bus, through which persistent data can be read or 
written using ordinary processor load and store operations. Processors access the NVM in the same way as they access
the DRAM. After the crash, all volatile state such as processor register file and cache content will be lost. Data
stored in NVM, as its name suggests, can survive crashes and be used for post-failure recovery.
