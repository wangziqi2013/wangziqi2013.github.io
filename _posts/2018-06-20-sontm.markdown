SONTM is a Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) design that replicates the well-known interval-based 
OCC which was originally proposed for software implementation. Classical backward Optimistic Concurrency 
Control (OCC) protocols introduces false aborts, because they assume read/write conflict as long as 
the read set of a reading transaction has a non-empty intersection with write sets of transactions whose
write phase overlaps with its read phase. In fact, if the reading transaction only reads values after 
the committing transactions have updated them, the schedule should be serializable.
