This paper proposes iDO, a crash recovery scheme based on Non-Volatile Memory using idempotent regions. Classical crash
recovery schemes, such as undo logging, redo logging, and shadow mapping, incur too much overhead by maintaining a runtime
write set and persisting data into the NVM with heavy-weight barriers. A more recent proposal, Justdo Logging, abandons 
per-store logging and data-centric approach of recovery, and instead, relies on the re-execution of the Failure-Atomic
Section (FASE) to reproduce the state before the crash, and furthermore, restore the consistent system state by executing
the FASE till completion. Although Justdo logging may offer better performance because of less persistence barrier, it 
has two constraints which may hinder its practicability. First, Justdo logging assumes a non-volatile cache, which is not 
yet available on today's architecture. Even on future platforms where the cache can be made persistent or be backed 
by a battery, the feasibility of persistent cache is still questionable. Second, Justdo logging requires FASEs be compiled
in a way such that no variable is allocated in the register. To support resumation of execution from an arbitrary point
within the FASE, all memory states must be consistent at the point of crash. If a variable is allocated in the register,
then the most up-to-date value of the variable will be lost, resulting in an invalid snapshot. To enforce this allocation
rule, all variables within a FASE must be declared as volatile, which forces writes to these variables to be conducted 
on the memory address. 

Instead of performing value-based logging, or changing compiler's optimization, iDO leverages the notion of idempotent 
regions. An idempotent region is a one-entry, multiple-exit deterministic code block, the execution of which always 
output the same result given the same input. The general idea is that, if we can divide FASEs into idempotent regions,
then as long as we
