This paper proposes SAND, a serverless framework with reduces cold start latency, and is specifically optimized for 
function chaining. The paper is motived by the fact that existing serverless
platforms suffer from cold start latency, and existing solutions of using warm-up instances will significantly increase
the resource consumption. Besides, function calls from the internals of an application, namely, chained function calls,
are handled no different from external requests, which incurs unnecessary performance overhead.
This paper addresses these two issues in SAND by using application-level sandboxes and local message bus, respectively.

The paper observes that existing service providers use either containers or virtual machines to isolate function 
instances. In the simplest case, each function instance is mapped to one instance of virtualized process, which executes
to the end, and then the instance will be destroyed.
