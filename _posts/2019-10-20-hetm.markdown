This paper presenrs HeTM, a unified transactional memory capable of running on both CPU and GPU. The paper
begins by identifying that some modern workloads can benefit greatly from the high parallelism provided by GPGPU, while
requiring transactional semantics, i.e. individual threads must appear that they are executed in a certain total ordering.
The paper proposes a scheme for incorporating the TM semnatics into GPGPU's SIMT execution model, enabling concurrent execution of transactions on both devices while maintaining the global transactional semantics by the application of hierarchical 
conflict detection. We describe the scheme as follows.

The paper assumes that non-heterogeneous TM implementations exist on both CPU and GPU. The paper does not specify the 
implementation to be used, but rather, in order for a TM implementation to work correctly under HeTM, they must provide 
the abstration that transactions on each device execute independently which can be regarded as an atomic operation. In addition,
all transactions, including those that finally abort, must not dependent on other transactions that aborted, i.e. aborted 
states should not affect the outcome of execution. The latter property is critical to HeTM, since transactions on both
devices execute locally before they eventually synchronize.
