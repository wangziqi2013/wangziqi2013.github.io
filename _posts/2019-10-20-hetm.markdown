This paper presenrs HeTM, a unified transactional memory capable of running on both CPU and GPU. The paper
begins by identifying that some modern workloads can benefit greatly from the high parallelism provided by GPGPU, while
requiring transactional semantics, i.e. individual threads must appear that they are executed in a certain total ordering.
The paper proposes a scheme for incorporating the TM semnatics into GPGPU's SIMT execution model, enabling concurrent execution of transactions on both devices while maintaining the global transactional semantics by the application of hierarchical 
conflict detection. We describe the scheme as follows.

The paper assumes that non-heterogeneous TM implementations exist on both CPU and GPU. The paper does not specify the 
implementation to be used, but rather, in order for a TM implementation to work correctly under HeTM, they must provide 
the abstration that transactions on each device are assigned commit timestamps which are consistent with the logical ordering. 
In addition, all transactions, including those that finally abort, must not dependent on other transactions that aborted, 
i.e. aborted states should not affect the outcome of execution. The latter property is critical to HeTM, since transactions 
on both devices execute locally before they eventually synchronize. If transactions' outcome are dependent on uncommitted 
states, the result of local executions may not be equivalent to the result of an abstract, globally serial history. 

HeTM provides a transactional interface for programmers to wrap the transaction body and arguments. Instead of the traditional
model of execution in which the body is executed immediately after the transaction begin instruction, HeTM adopts 
a queuing execution model for better scheduling on GPU. The queuing model in HeTM wraps transaction body and arguments into
an instance of the transaction, which is then pushed into a transaction queue. For heterogeneous system consisting of
a CPU and a GPU, three queues are provided: The CPU queue, the GPU queue, and the shared queue. An instance is pushed into
the first two queues if the programmer specifies device affinity when starting the transaction. The transaction is pushed 
into the shared queue otherwise. A scheduler selects transactions from the three queues, and dispstach them to the corresponding
device based on the type of the queue and/or the queue length. For the CPU queue, the scheduler selects one instance at a time
and dispatches it to an idle core for execution. For the GPU queue, the scheduler waits until there are sufficient number
of instances, and then dispatch the batch to a transaction kernel running on the GPU. The transaction kernel is the GPU 
version of the transaction body written by the programmer. Note that HeTM requires that programmers provide both implementations
of the transaction body if transactions are to be executed on both devices. Transactions in the shared queue can be dispatched
to either device. 

HeTM assumes that transactional metadata is only maintained for a subset of the available addresses. This subset of addresses
is called a "Speculative Transaction Memory Region" (STMR).
