This paper proposes COP, a memory ECC design which delivers protection without the extra hardware overhead. 
Conventional ECC-protected memory module often has an extra chip on a rank, enabling an extra 8 bytes of data to be read
in parallel with 64 byte cache line data. Such dedicated ECC hardware not only cost more than a regular non-ECC memory,
but also consumes substantially more power during operation, due to the extra read on the ECC chip.
Prior publications also seek to implement hardware ECC check for non-ECC memory modules. A dedicated ECC region is 
allocated from the physical memory, which stores the ECC bits for each memory block in the rest of the address space.
These schemes, however, suffer from various problems.
