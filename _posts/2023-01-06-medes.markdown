This paper presents Medes, an in-memory deduplication module that enables fast startups of serverless functions.
Medes is built based on the observation that serverless functions running on a cluster often share identical or 
similar pages, which can then be leveraged for deduplication. The deduplicated function instances consume less 
memory and can hence be preserved in the memory in a warm state for a longer period without causing memory pressure. 
Medes achieves this design goal by using process checkpoints and fingerprint hashing to identify similarities between
process images.
