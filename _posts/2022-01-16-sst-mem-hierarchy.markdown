# Memory Hierarchy

## MemEventBase and MemEvent

`class MemEventBase` and `class MemEvent` are the two classes that are used throughout the memory hierarchy to model
message exchange between memory components, and to carry the commands as well as responses.
They are defined in file `memEventBase.h` and `memEvent.h`, respectively. The related constants, macros, such as
memory commands, coherence states, and command classes, are defined separately in `memTypes.h`.
