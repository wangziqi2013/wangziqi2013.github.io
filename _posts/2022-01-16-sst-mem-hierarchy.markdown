# Memory Hierarchy

## MemEventBase and MemEvent

`class MemEventBase` and `class MemEvent` are the two classes that are used throughout the memory hierarchy to model
message exchange between memory components, and to carry the commands as well as responses.
They are defined in file `memEventBase.h` and `memEvent.h`, respectively. The related constants, macros, such as
memory commands, coherence states, and command classes, are defined separately in `memTypes.h`.

Both classes are derived from the base class `class Event`, meaning that they can be sent over link objects just like
any other event objects. `class MemEventBase` defines low-level link layer properties of the message, such as 
source and destination names (which, surprisingly, are of `std::string` type) of the current hop, `src_` and `dst_`, 
the original requestor's name (which is also an `std::string`), `rqstr_`, and the globally unique event ID, 
`eventID_`.
