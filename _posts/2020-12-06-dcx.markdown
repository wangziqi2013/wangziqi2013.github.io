This paper proposes Data Compression Extension (DCX) instruction set extension for performing simple data compression
on heap-allocated data. Compared with conventional data compression approaches, where all cache lines in a certain
address range or all objects are compressed without distinction, the DCX proposal allows software to select certain 
fields as compression candidates, and only compresses these fields in the run-time, avoiding unnecessary overhead
of compression if applied to uncompressible data.

DCX is based on two observations. First, most pointer values to heap memory share common higher-order bits, since 
these memory blocks are typically created by an allocator that tend to group addresses that are close to each other
for better access locality. Besides, some systems have a hard constraint on higher-order bits of pointers, further
consolidating this observation.
