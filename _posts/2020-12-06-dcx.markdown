This paper proposes Data Compression Extension (DCX) instruction set extension for performing simple data compression
on heap-allocated data. Compared with conventional data compression approaches, where all cache lines in a certain
address range or all objects are compressed without distinction, the DCX proposal allows software to select certain 
fields as compression candidates, and only compresses these fields in the run-time, avoiding unnecessary overhead
of compression if applied to uncompressible data.
