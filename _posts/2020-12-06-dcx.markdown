**Lowlight:**

1. The paper proposes that pointer values can be compressed with a common prefix. But it never identified how the
   common prefix is maintained and stored, and what if the common prefix changes. Do we keep only one such prefix
   for all pointer values, or we can use multiple prefixes? Obviously the runtime should provide storage for
   keeping the prefix, such that the compression/decompression instructions have a way of using them in the
   instructions.

This paper proposes Data Compression Extension (DCX) instruction set extension for performing simple data compression
on heap-allocated data. Compared with conventional data compression approaches, where all cache lines in a certain
address range or all objects are compressed without distinction, the DCX proposal allows software to select certain 
fields as compression candidates, and only compresses these fields in the run-time, avoiding unnecessary overhead
of compression if applied to uncompressible data.

DCX is based on two observations. First, most pointer values to heap memory share common higher-order bits, since 
these memory blocks are typically created by an allocator that tend to group addresses that are close to each other
for better access locality. Besides, some systems have a hard constraint on higher-order bits of pointers, further
consolidating this observation.
Second, most integers values used in real-world workloads do not exploit all bits in a 32-bit integer (the paper assumes
32-bit integers and pointers). These integers can be compressed with less number of bits, as long as the higher-order
bits are identical to the sign bit after compression. The original value can be easily compressed restored without any
external information just by eliminating and replicating the sign bit respectively.
