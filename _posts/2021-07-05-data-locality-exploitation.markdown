**Comments:**

1. The authors may have used "block" and "slot" interchangeably, which is confusing.
   For example, in Section 3.1 it says "Dual-block compression is attempted when multiple
   **blocks** in the same sector are not compressible into a single
   **block**.". I guess the second "block" should be "slot".
