**Comments:**

1. The authors may have used "block" and "slot" interchangeably, which is confusing.
   For example, in Section 3.1 it says "Dual-block compression is attempted when multiple
   **blocks** in the same sector are not compressible into a single
   **block**.". I guess the second "block" should be "slot".

This paper proposes Dual-Block Compression, a YACC-based cache compression technique that leverages inter-block 
redundancy for higher compression ratio.
The paper is motivated by a third type of locality: data value locality, in addition to the well-known spatial and
temporal locality. Data value locality suggests that there is a high chance that values in nearby memory locations 
will contain identical or regular values, as a result of loops in the program.
As a result, static dictionary-based algorithms (i.e., dictionaries are generated statically and stored along with
the block, rather than generated dynamically) work pretty well on these data patterns, since only a few values are
sufficient to encode an entire block.
The paper further notices that the pattern can extend across several memory blocks, making it possible to share the 
same dictionary for these blocks. This approach has a clear advantage of avoiding storing multiple dictionary entries
for each block, potentially achieving a higher compression ratio.
