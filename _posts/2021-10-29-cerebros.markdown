This paper proposes Cerebros, a hardware accelerator that offloads the responsibility of RPC handling from the CPU
to an NIC-attached module. The paper is motivated by the high performance overhead and ill-suited nature of RPC
handling, and it proposes to offload part of the RPC handling, i.e., header parsing, function dispatch, and 
argument deserialization, to the network layer with an interface featuring hardware-software interplay.
