This paper proposes Cerebros, a hardware accelerator that offloads the responsibility of RPC handling from the CPU
to an NIC-attached module. The paper is motivated by the high performance overhead and ill-suited nature of RPC
handling, and it proposes to offload part of the RPC handling, i.e., header parsing, function dispatch, and 
argument deserialization, to the network layer with an interface featuring hardware-software interplay.

As the microservice architecture becomes a major software engineering trend, the efficiency of Remote Procedure Call 
(RPC) has reemerged as an important factor in the overall performance of microservices, since the architecture 
divides software components into simple, standalone modules, each running in their own process address space as 
an independent unit, hence achieving functional and failure isolation. Function calls between modules, which was 
done with a single call instruction, is now replaced with more heavyweight RPC invocations. The paper points out
that the overhead of performing RPCs in datacenters, dubbed as the "RPC tax", can be as much as 40% - 90% of the 
total execution cycles. This situation can only become worse, because: (1) Microservices can also perform recursive RPC
calls, such that the RPC tax will multiply and be propagated at all levels of the recursive call;
