This paper proposes Themis, a lightweight persistent ordering architecture for NVM applications. The paper begins by
observation that most NVM applications, if not all, uses persistence barrier to guarantee write ordering. Using undo
logging as an example, the log entry must reach the NVM before dirty data does, because otherwise, if the system
crashes before the two persistence operations, dirty data would not be able to recovery to the pre-image before
the transaction, corrupting program data.
