This paper proposes CSALT, a cache partitioning scheme for unified L3 TLB and data on lower level caches. The paper 
identifies that, on modern platform where virtualization is supported, running multiple virtual machines can overburden
the TLB with excessive misses, resulting in a massive number of page walks. A page walk on today's 2-D page table 
can take, in the worst case, 24 memory accesses (20 for accessing host page table for every guest physical address, 
and 4 for the standard 4-level guest translation).
