This paper proposes the Tag-Less Cache (TLC) architecture to reduce energy consumption of conventional L1 caches.
The paper is motivated by the fact that conventional caches are rather power hungry, which is caused by two 
design choices. First, cache accesses always need tag comparisons in order to locate the data block in one of the 
many ways, or declare a cache miss. 
Second, to reduce access latency, both the tags and data blocks in the set are read in parallel after the set index is 
computed, and only one of the blocks is selected in the case of a cache hit, which wastes the energy consumed by 
accessing the rest of the set.
The waste can be quite significant, since the entire set is accessed, while at most one of them will be actually useful.

Previous works attempt to reduce energy issues of cache accesses with two techniques. The first one, staged access, 
serializes the tag access and data access into two phases. Only the way in the data bank that contains the requested 
block will be accessed, if it is a hit, or the data bank is not accessed at all, if it is a miss.
