This paper proposes the Tag-Less Cache (TLC) architecture to reduce energy consumption of conventional L1 caches.
The paper is motivated by the fact that conventional caches are rather power hungry, which is caused by two 
design choices. First, cache accesses always need tag comparisons in order to locate the data block in one of the 
many ways, or declare a cache miss.
