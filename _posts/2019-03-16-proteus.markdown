This paper presents Proteus, a hardware extension on NVM based architectures for supporting atomic durability. Prior to 
Proteus, past designs tend to either only focus on software side or on the hardware side. Software solutions require 
programmers or compilers to insert software persist barriers to enforce correct write ordering. For example, Intel provided 
programmers with a set of new instructions, called PMEM, to compose persist barriers on x86 based architectures. A persist
barrier using PMEM consists of one or more cache line flush instructions, and a pcommit instruction at the end. The cache 
line flush instructions make sure that all dirty states are written into the NVM controller, and pcommit guarantees that
NVM controller has drained its internal write queue. Dirty states generated before the barrier and flushed by the cache line 
flush instructions are guaranteed to be persistent on the NVM after the barrier returns. Store fences are also inserted 
to impose correct memory ordering between PMEM instructions and earlier store instructions. Though not requiring any expensive
hardware changes and can be deployed quickly, software barriers are overly conservative, and are slow and cumbersome to use. 
This is because programmers have no control over how cache lines are maintained by the hardware cache and how dirty lines 
are written back by the NVM controller. In contrast, hardware solutions generally require extending the cache, the directory,
or the memory controller to automate logging and recovery. They resort to hardware address remapping in the case of 
Copy-on-Write (COW), or hardware store queue in the case of undo logging. The problem with hardware solutions is that
on-chip storage resources are often scarce and have limitations (e.g. access latency, capacity, etc.), which further puts 
a hard limit on the number of concurrent transactions or the maximum read/write sets. When the working set of a transaction
exceeds these hard limits, hardware systems either need to stall to wait for resource, or use software handler as a fall
back path.

Proteus, on the other hand, borrows from both sides and achieves the favorable characteristics of software and hardware 
approaches. Compared with software solutions, Proteus relies on programmers or compilers to mark transaction boundaries
as well as to issue instructions that generate and flushe log entries, when shared data items are updated during a transaction.
Compared with hardware solutions, Proteus similarly extends the processor with a log write queue which stores pending log
entries to be written. In addition, an extra log pending queue is added to the memory controller, such that some log entries 
do not even need to be written to the NVM if the transaction commits before the queue overflows. We elaborate on these designs
in the following sections.

Protus assumes transactional semantics for durable writes: Either all writes within a transaction become durable as the 
transaction commits, or none of them becomes durable, and the transaction is aborted. Special instructions are needed
to begin and attempt to commit a durable transaction. When generating code for a transaction body, compilers are responsible 
for expanding every transactional store instruction to global data items into three instructions: One for reading the old
value and generating the log entry, another for writing data that has been loaded into the cache, and the last for writing
the log entry into NVM logging area. Semantics and implementation of the three instructions will be covered in details. 
Each transaction is allocated a unique transaction ID (TID) when it commits. The TID is useful not only for conflict detection
purposes, but also for the hardware to identify which log entry belongs to which transaction, as we will see later.

Two new instructions are added to the ISA: log-load and log-flush. The log-load instruction takes one address and one register 
argument. The address points to an aligned 32 byte memory block, which is the basic unit of logging in Protus. Choosing 32 bytes
as the logging unit is to reduce the number of NVM writes when the entry is flushed back to the NVM, since write back to 
NVM must be 64 byte, cache line sized memory block. A log entry consisting of 32 byte data plus metadata is guaranteed 
to be written back using just one write operation to the NVM. On executing the instruction, the processor attempts to load 
the L1 cache with the block on the given address if it has not been loaded (and raises exception as usual if the access 
is invalid), and the copy the 32 byte block to a special register, the log register. Log registers are 64 byte registers
allocated from a separate register file. Each log register holds the log entry, including data and metadata such as address
and property bits. On executing a log-load instruction, the processor issues a read, and uses the returned data to fill the
given log register. Compilers are responsible for allocating and reusing log registers. The second instruction is log-flush,
which writes the content of a given log register into a target address. Both the register name and the address are encoded
by the instruction. Note that, for undo logging based systems, if the same address can be logged multiple times (i.e. a 
log entry is generated every time the address is written), then undo log entries must be written by the order that these 
entries are generated. During recovery, only the earliest entry for an address is replayed, because later entries contain
dirty data written in the transaction, which should not be part of the state after roll back. To achieve this, Protus also
has a special register, LTA (Log Target Address),  for dispensing sequence numbers. The register is used to generate the 
address on NVM logging area, to which the log entry is written. After each read, the value of LTA is incremented.
