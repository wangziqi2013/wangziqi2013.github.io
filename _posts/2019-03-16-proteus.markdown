This paper presents Proteus, a hardware extension on NVM based architectures for supporting atomic durability. Prior to 
Proteus, past designs tend to either only focus on software side or on the hardware side. Software solutions require 
programmers or compilers to insert software persist barriers to enforce correct write ordering. For example, Intel provided 
programmers with a set of new instructions, called PMEM, to compose persist barriers on x86 based architectures. A persist
barrier using PMEM consists of one or more cache line flush instructions, and a pcommit instruction at the end. The cache 
line flush instructions make sure that all dirty states are written into the NVM controller, and pcommit guarantees that
NVM controller has drained its internal write queue. Dirty states generated before the barrier and flushed by the cache line 
flush instructions are guaranteed to be persistent on the NVM after the barrier returns. Store fences are also inserted 
to impose correct memory ordering between PMEM instructions and earlier store instructions. Though not requiring any expensive
hardware changes and can be deployed quickly, software barriers are overly conservative, and are slow and cumbersome to use. 
This is because programmers have no control over how cache lines are maintained by the hardware cache and how dirty lines 
are written back by the NVM controller. In contrast, hardware solutions generally require extending the cache, the directory,
or the memory controller to automate logging and recovery.
