This paper proposes ShortCut, a hardware mechanism for accelerating virtual function invocations for scripting 
languages.
The paper observes that scripting languages, which are often Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled, pay a huge overhead on
virtual function invocations, since these languages support dynamic resolution of function invocation, meaning
that the actual function being called on an object pointer is dependent on the runtime dynamic type of the 
object, which could not be determined statically at compilation time. 
As a solution, the JIT compiler needs to generate dispatch functions that call the corresponding implementation in the 
runtime based on the type of the object.
According to the paper, the dispatch function is a major source of slowdowns, which account for around 22% of the 
instructions being executed in applications.

The responsibility of dispatch functions is to map object types and access site to the corresponding function
implementation (functions at the same access sites are polymorphic and have the same symbol name).
The mapping is stored globally using a software mapping table, which is queried every time a function is called
at an access site.
To reduce the overhead, the JIT compiler may also generate in-line dispatch functions for each individual call sites 
that cache the result of queries for the particular call site.
