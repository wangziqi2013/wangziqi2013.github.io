This paper proposes ShortCut, a hardware mechanism for accelerating virtual function invocations for scripting 
languages.
The paper observes that scripting languages, which are often Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled, pay a huge overhead on
virtual function invocations, since these languages support dynamic resolution of function invocation, meaning
that the actual function being called on an object pointer is dependent on the runtime dynamic type of the 
object, which could not be determined statically at compilation time.
