This paper presents LB-Tree, or Line Write/Logless B+Tree, a NVM optimized B+Tree design for efficient updates.
Although not explicitly stated, the paper identifies a few inefficiencies in conventional in-memory B+Tree designs
when ported to the NVM, such as ordered nodes, the overhead of structural modifications, and maintaining consistent
node states.
