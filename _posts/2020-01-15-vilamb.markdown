This paper proposes Vilamb, a software solution to redundancy problems of NVM DAX storage. In conventional file 
systems, redundancy information of pages can be verified and updated when pages are fetched into or evicted from the page
buffer, which is controlled by the file system. For NVDIMM DAX mapped pages, however, the OS has no control over the fetch 
and eviction of cache line sized blocks, since the cache controller determines when a block enters and leaves the cache
hierarchy.
