This paper presents Quartz, a non-volatile memory simulator built on top of certain dvanced hardware features. At the time
of writing this paper, commercial product of NVM hardware is not yet available on the market. As a result, NVM researchers 
have to use simulators to evaluate their research. Although it is generally believed that NVM has similar performance 
characteristics as DRAM except for lower bandwidth and higher latency, this paper identifies several problems with existing 
NVM simulatoirs that can make them infeasible to use.

Compared
with previous simulators, Quartz does not simulate the full functionality
