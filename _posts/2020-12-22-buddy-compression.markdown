This paper proposes Buddy Compression, a GPGPU main memory compression scheme for simplicity and effectiveness.
The paper is motived by the fact that modern GPU workload sizes often exceed the maximum possible memory size 
of the GPU device, while the latter is difficult to scale due to physical constraints.
