This paper proposes a cache friendly implementation of global commit counter commonly
used by software transactional memory designs. Many STM and Hybrid TM algorithm, notably Transactional 
Locking II (TL2) and NORec, relies on a global timestamp counter to either commit events, either 
for individual data items or globally. The most straightforward implementation of the counter is 
to use a 64 bit integer incremented every time a transaction commits. Verification of read 
sets is performed by comparing the value of the counter when the transaction begins and the most up-to-date
value on data items or of the same counter.
