This paper presents Distributed Shared Persistent Memory (DSPM), an architecture and software stack for large-scale 
distributed NVM deployment. Prior proposals already implement distributed shared DRAM and distributed storage array
based on DRAM and disks. The paper points out, however, that the same technique cannot be directly ported to support 
distributed NVM for two reasons. First, although conventional DSM implements software-based coherence, caching, etc.,
some critical features for NVM are still missing, such as distributed object naming and replication support. Second, 
distributed storage systems are mostly implemented as file system services or object-based stores. The software
overhead for maintaining the abstraction is too large, given the relatively fast access speed of NVM.
