This paper proposes Crafty, a novel software transaction memory design based on re-execution. The paper begins 
by observing that all previous designs have non-negligible run-time costs that root deeply into the methodology.
The paper investigates into three typical mechanisms: undo logging, redo logging, and shadow paging.
Undo logging requires write ordering between the log entry and the data block being written. As a result, each
write operation must be preceded by log generation and persistence, which has a large overhead since the log 
flush uses what is called a persist barrier. The barrier, which typically consists of several cache flush
instructions followed by a store fence (clwb and sfence on x86), stalls the pipeline for at least the amount
of time required for a round-trip between the cache hierarchy and the NVM controller, which is usually a few
hundreds of cycles, causing performance degradation.
