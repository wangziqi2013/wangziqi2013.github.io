This paper proposes Crafty, a novel software transaction memory design based on re-execution. The paper begins 
by observing that all previous designs have non-negligible run-time costs that root deeply into the methodology.
The paper investigates into three typical mechanisms: undo logging, redo logging, and shadow paging.
