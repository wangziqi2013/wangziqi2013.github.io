**Comments:**

1. I wonder whether control dependency should be strictly followed (as ASAP does). Imagine two transactions 
on the same thread, one of them writes location X, the other one writes location Y. These two transactions have no
dependency and can be committed entirely out-of-order. It does not matter whether one of them gets lost while the other
one is undone during recovery.
On the other hand, the persistency model assumed by this paper might be that the recovered state should be 
one that conforms to the logical ordering, which indeed requires control dependency to be followed.
