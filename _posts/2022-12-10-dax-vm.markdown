This paper proposes DaxVM, a virtual memory abstraction that facilitates the user scenarios of direct-mapped NVM.
DaxVM is motivated by the fact that traditional virtual memory interfaces, i.e., mmap() and munmap(), are not 
implemented properly for direct-mapped NVM due to their original purpose of supporting disk-file based mapping 
or anonymous mapping. As a result, applications may suffer issues such as paging overhead, kernel lock contention,
expensive operations on the critical path, and so on. As a solution, the paper proposes changing the implementation
of virtual memory interfaces as well as adding new interfaces in order to optimize system performance for direct-mapped 
NVM.

The paper assumes direct-mapped NVM access, in which the NVM storage is mapped into part of the physical address space.
The NVM-based file system manages NVM storage area and allocates NVM pages to files as in a regular file system.
When a file is to be accessed by user applications, instead of using the traditional file system calls such as 
open(), read() and write(), the file system enables applications to directly map the physical pages of the file 
into the virtual address space of the application via mmap(). The mapped file can then be accessed as a memory object
while the OS handles pages faults as well as the mappings between the virtual and the physical addresses.
