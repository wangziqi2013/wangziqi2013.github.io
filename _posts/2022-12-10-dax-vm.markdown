This paper proposes DaxVM, a virtual memory abstraction that facilitates the user scenarios of direct-mapped NVM.
DaxVM is motivated by the fact that traditional virtual memory interfaces, i.e., mmap() and munmap(), are not 
implemented properly for direct-mapped NVM due to their original purpose of supporting disk-file based mapping 
or anonymous mapping. As a result, applications may suffer issues such as paging overhead, kernel lock contention,
expensive operations on the critical path, and so on. As a solution, the paper proposes changing the implementation
of virtual memory interfaces as well as adding new interfaces in order to optimize system performance for direct-mapped 
NVM.
