This paper proposes Dynamic Frequent Pattern Compression (DFPC), a data compression scheme for reducing NVM wear.
The paper is motivated by the fact that current NVM devices have limited number of write-erase cycles, and that 
excessive writes not only consume bandwidth, but also harm its lifespan.
Previous works attempt to address this issue with two techniques: Compression and Flip-and-Write (FNW).
Cache blocks are first compressed to reduce the number of bits to be written into the device, and compressed data is 
either as the original binary or as a bit complement of the original to minimize the number of bits flips.
In such an architecture, each cache block sized data on the NVM is tagged with 2-bit metadata, one bit for 
indicating whether the block is compressed, and the other bit to indicate whether the data is stored as flipped.

This paper, however, points out that static Frequent Pattern Compression (SPFC), which is used by previous work,
fails to compress certain patterns that occur frequently in the run time. 
The classical SFPC algorithm divides the input stream into 32-bit words, and only compares these words with certain
pattern masks (e.g., 00XX, where 0 means the byte has a literal value of zero, and X means do not care which will be
encoded in the output code word).
