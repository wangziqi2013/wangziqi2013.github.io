This paper presents Janus, an framework for efficient handling of Backend Memory Operations (BMO) on Non-Volatile Memory 
(NVM) controllers. In the introduction section, the paper identifies a major bottleneck of NVM operations in addition to loads: 
stores and the correspoinding BMOs. Two factors contribute to this conclusition. First, in order to achieve crash 
persistency and recovery, most NVM applications use some form of logging or shadowing. These techniques enforce write ordering
between the log and actual data. For example, in undo logging scheme, the undo image is generated before the data
is written into the cache line, and then written to the NVM to avoid the unrecoverable case in which a dirty cache line
is evicted to the NVM before the corresponding undo image does. Write ordering incurs extra latency on store operations, 
which also blocks the processor pipeline, constituting a critical path. Second, most NVM devices also provide capabilities 
beyond persistence. For example, encryption, data compression, and deduplication are all important features for NVM
device. These features require that the NVM device perform computations such as hashing, table lookup, key generation, etc. 
on the backend (i.e. BMOs) when a cache line is evicted or flushed from the processor, which can further add to the latency 
of store operations, aggravating the store bottleneck.  

This paper employs two techniques to reduce the latency of BMO: parallization and pre-computation. With parallelization,
some operations from different tasks can be performed at the same time, as long as they are independent from each other.
This paper identifies four types of dependence:
