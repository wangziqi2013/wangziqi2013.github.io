This paper presents Janus, an framework for efficient handling of Backend Memory Operations (BMO) on Non-Volatile Memory 
(NVM) controllers. In the introduction section, the paper identifies a major bottleneck of NVM operations in addition to loads: 
stores and the correspoinding BMOs. Two factors contribute to this conclusition. First, in order to achieve crash 
persistency and recovery, most NVM applications use some form of logging or shadowing. These techniques enforce write ordering
between the log and actual data. For example, in undo logging scheme, the undo image is generated before the data
is written into the cache line, and then written to the NVM to avoid the unrecoverable case in which a dirty cache line
is evicted to the NVM before the corresponding undo image does. Write ordering incurs extra latency on store operations, 
which also blocks the processor pipeline, constituting a critical path.
