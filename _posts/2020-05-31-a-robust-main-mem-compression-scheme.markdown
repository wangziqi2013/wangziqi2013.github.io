This paper proposes a simple but yet efficient main memory compression scheme. The proposed scheme is meant to be general
enough to be applied to any system with minimum application level modification, and also efficient for space saving
under the current virtual memory framework. The paper identifies three major challenges of designing a main memory 
compression scheme.
