This paper proposes deduplicated last-level cache for increasing effective cache size. Previously, researchers have been 
proposing techniques such as cache compression on block basis to reduce the size of a cache line, increasing effective
cache size. This paper adopts a different approach by identifying the potential of cache deduplication, a technique for
detecting iddentical cache lines and avoiding storing multiple physical line with the same content.
The paper begins by making the claim that in scientific computation workloads, cache lines are likely to contain duplicated
data for several reasons. First, some workloads tend to copy the same piece of data around for the purpose of initialization
or interfacing with libraries requiring input/output buffer (e.g. network protocol or file system operation).
Applications that extensively use memcpy() also creates duplicated lines on different physical locations.
The second cause for duplication is symmetry of the program input. More than often, scientific applications begin their
computation with highly regular data consisting of duplicated patterns. Such pattern can also be exploited to reduce 
cache consumption.
The paper also noted that most of these duplicated lines are not pure zeros. Simply detecting zero lines will not work
well in the majority of the cases.
