This paper proposes deduplicated last-level cache for increasing effective cache size. Previously, researchers have been 
proposing techniques such as cache compression on block basis to reduce the size of a cache line, increasing effective
cache size. This paper adopts a different approach by identifying the potential of cache deduplication, a technique for
detecting iddentical cache lines and avoiding storing multiple physical line with the same content.
