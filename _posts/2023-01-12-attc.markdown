This paper proposes ATTC, a hardware TLB coherence scheme that eliminates the overhead of software TLB shootdown
in a virtualized environment. ATTC is built upon cache coherence and it reuses the existing cache coherence network
to perform TLB coherence on hardware. Compared with prior schemes that also rely on cache coherence, ATTC handles 
virtualized environments better and incurs only minimum hardware additions on the TLB structure.
