**Comments:**

1. Modern TLB entries have two disambiguation fields. One is VMID which distinguishes between VMs and the 
VMM, which the paper discusses. The other, however, is PCID which distinguishes between different processes 
within the same VM instance or within the VMM/host OS, which the paper neglects. How does the PCID field
affect the design of ATTC?

2. The paper did not discuss how are the tables (ATLB and INVTBL) populated. Are they populated automatically by 
the MMU page walker on the completion of page walks? Are they populated by the guest or host OS (unlikely)?
It seems that the paper adds the ATLB as a level 3 in-memory TLB. If this assumption is true, then the ATLB
should be populated by the page walker.

This paper proposes ATTC, a hardware TLB coherence scheme that eliminates the overhead of software TLB shootdown
in a virtualized environment. ATTC is built upon cache coherence and it reuses the existing cache coherence network
to perform TLB coherence on hardware. Compared with prior schemes that also rely on cache coherence, ATTC handles 
virtualized environments better and incurs only minimum hardware additions on the TLB structure.
