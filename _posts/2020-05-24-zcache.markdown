This paper proposes ZCache, a cache array design that decouples ways from associativity. Traditional set-associative 
cache lookup and replacement policies are based on the concept of sets, which consists of a few ways. All addresses
are mapped to individual sets, in which the address can be stored by any of the way. The paper points out that
this organization prevents an optimal or near optimal replacement decision from being made, since the replacement policy,
regardless of which policy it is as long as the domain is within the set, can only evict an existing block from the 
current set, while some where in the cache a better candidate may exist. 

The paper identifies the root cause of non-optimal or even bad replacement decisions as coupled cache replacement policy
and cache line placement policy on a miss. Associativity is defined for both replacement and placement. When a miss occurs
and the target line is fetched from the lower level, the placement policy dictates which blocks could be used to store
the line. When a set conflict miss occurs, the replacement policy determines, from a pool of candidates, which lines 
should be evicted for the new line.
