This paper proposes ZCache, a cache array design that decouples ways from associativity. Traditional set-associative 
cache lookup and replacement policies are based on the concept of sets, which consists of a few ways. All addresses
are mapped to individual sets, in which the address can be stored by any of the way. The paper points out that
this organization prevents an optimal or near optimal replacement decision from being made, since the replacement policy,
regardless of which policy it is as long as the domain is within the set, can only evict an existing block from the 
current set, while some where in the cache a better candidate may exist.
