This paper proposes Stash, a globally addressable, cache coherent scratchpad memory architecture for GPGPU. 
The paper is motivated by the fact that existing commercial implementations of scratchpad memory has limited efficiency
and usability due to the private, non-cache coherent address space. Stash addresses these issues by allowing the
scratchpad memory to translate its private address to and from the global virtual address, such that the scratchpad
memory can be loaded like a traditional cache om-demand, while maintaining easy access by retaining the direct 
addressing and fine-grained access capabilities of existing scratchpad memory.
