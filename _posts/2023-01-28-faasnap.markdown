This paper presents FaaSnap, a serverless (Function-as-a-Service, FaaS) framework that enables fast function invocation
by using efficient snapshotting. The paper is motivated by the high cold-start latency of function invocation in
production environments. While prior works have already explored the idea of leveraging memory snapshots for fast
startups, FaaSnap further optimizes the snapshotting algorithm such that both the I/O cost and the latency penalty 
for loading the snapshot is minimized. When evaluated on a variety of serverless workloads, FaaSnap achieves nearly 
ideal performance compared with warm startups which also outperforms prior works in general.
