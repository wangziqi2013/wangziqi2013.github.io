This paper proposes KiloTM, a hardware transactional memory design for GPGPU. This paper identifies several benefits
of introducing HTM to GPGPU. First, GPGPU features heavily threaded workloads. Interactions between threads are difficult
to manage, which poses great challenge for debugging and program verification. Second,
