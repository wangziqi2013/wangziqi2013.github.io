This paper proposes KiloTM, a hardware transactional memory design for GPGPU. This paper identifies several benefits
of introducing HTM to GPGPU. First, GPGPU features heavily threaded workloads. Interactions between threads are difficult
to manage, which poses great challenge for debugging and program verification. Second, the SIMT execution model used by 
GPGPUs can cause deadlock for fine-grained locking. Threads waiting for a lock that has already been taken by some other
threads can be permanently blocked due to the fact that SIMT introduces new implicit control dependencies between threads. 
GPGPUs do not attempt to solve this problem, but rather, they offload the responsibility of finding synchronization bugs 
to programmers. In this situation, HTM can be of great help since they are non-blocking, and enables fast prototyping
of concurrent data structures at the cost of slightly slower execution.
