This paper proposes two techniques for optimizing the performance of micro-operation (uop) cache on x86 processors.
The uop cache is an important component on the frontend pipeline, since it stores and feeds decoded uops to the 
backend without involving the instruction cache and the decoder. This reduces both pipeline depth, instruction feed
latency, and energy consumption, which all help in performance improvement.
Current implementation of the uop cache suffers from external fragmentation, which originates from the fact that uop
cache entries are variably sized. A fragmented uop cache negatively affects performance, since it reduces the effective 
size of the cache, which can further stall the backend pipeline due to insufficient instruction bandwidth.

The paper assumes a uop cache architecture as follows. The uop cache itself is implemented just like a regular cache,
with ways and sets and fixed size (64 bytes) slots. Uops, once they are generated by the instruction decoder, are 
first aggregated in an accumulation buffer, after which they are inserted into the uop cache as individual entries.
