This paper proposes two techniques for optimizing the performance of micro-operation (uop) cache on x86 processors.
Current implementation of the uop cache suffers from external fragmentation, which originates from the fact that uop
cache entries are variably sized. A fragmented uop cache negatively affects performance, since it reduces the effective 
size of the cache, which can further stall the backend pipeline due to insufficient instruction bandwidth.
