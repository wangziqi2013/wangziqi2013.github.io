This paper evaluates the performane of NVM on several disk-based and NVM-based storage systems. The emergence of NVM
raises the new chanllenge of programming for fine-grained persistence devices that can be directly accessed by processors.
On the other hand, existing software stacks, such as file systems, are mostly designed for block persistent devices 
such as disks or SSD. These designs provide an entirely different set of interfaces for interacting with the
device and fetching/updating data, and/or manage data/metadata in a way that is significantly inefficient for newer hardware, 
making it a challenging task to migrate them from the old platforms to newer NVM-based platform.
