This paper evaluates the performane of NVM on several disk-based and NVM-based storage systems. The emergence of NVM
raises the new chanllenge of programming for fine-grained persistence devices that can be directly accessed by processors.
On the other hand, existing software stacks, such as file systems, are mostly designed for block persistent devices 
such as magnetic disks or SSD. These designs provide an entirely different set of interfaces from what we are failiar with
for in-memory applications in order to interact with the device, and/or manage data/metadata in a way that may not perform
very well for newer hardware. Both of these make it a challenging task to migrate them from the old platforms to newer 
NVM-based platform.

This paper explores the necessary by running a set of benchmarks on existing systems built on the disk interface
