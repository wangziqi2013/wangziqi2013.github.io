This paper proposes Direct-to-Master (D2M) cache, a tag-less cache architecture in multicore environments.
The D2M proposal is based on a previous Direct-to-Data (D2D) design, in which cache block locations in the private
L1 and L2 caches are tracked with a two-level hierarchy of metadata stores, namely, the eTLB and the Hub.
D2M further extends the architecture to a shared LLC cache with multicore coherence.

In the original D2D work, which can be found [here]({% post_url 2021-09-01-d2d%}), per-block address tags are eliminated
from the private hierarchy. Instead, a centralized repository for tracking cache line locations, including the cache
component and the way number, which is called the Hub, is added to the private hierarchy.
The Hub is essentially a set-associative sector cache tag array that uses super-blocks of 4KB page size.
Each entry of the Hub stores the valid bit, the component that an address is currently cached in, and the way number
in the cache. Set indices are not stored, as they can be directly generated from the virtual or physical address
(depending on the cache size: for L1 it is fully virtual, while for L2 it also needs a few bits from the physical
page number).
