This paper proposes Redu, a transaction system that supports atomic durability using redo logs. Prior designs of 
transactional systems with durability must use one of the three logging schemes: (1) undo, where the before-image of the 
data item being modified is recorded in the log; (2) redo, where the after-image of the data item being modified is 
recorded in the log. In this case, the actual data item on NVM may not actually be modified, because the log 
is sufficient for reproducing the modifications; (3) redo + undo where both before- and after-image are saved 
in the log. This scheme allows more flexible handling of cache lines, because both uncommitted and committed 
transactions can be handled by the recovery routine using the log.
